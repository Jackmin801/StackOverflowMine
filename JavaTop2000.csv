"11227809","1","11227902","","2012-06-27 13:51:36","","24856","1528592","<p>Here is a piece of C++ code that shows some very peculiar behavior. For some strange reason, sorting the data miraculously makes the code almost six times faster:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    // Generate data
    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster.
    std::sort(data, data + arraySize);

    // Test
    clock_t start = clock();
    long long sum = 0;

    for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
    {
        // Primary loop
        for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        {
            if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                sum += data[c];
        }
    }

    double elapsedTime = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; elapsedTime &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;sum = &quot; &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Without <code>std::sort(data, data + arraySize);</code>, the code runs in 11.54 seconds.</li>
<li>With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly, so I tried Java:</p>
<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Generate data
        int arraySize = 32768;
        int data[] = new int[arraySize];

        Random rnd = new Random(0);
        for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;

        // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
        Arrays.sort(data);

        // Test
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        long sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
        {
            // Primary loop
            for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            {
                if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                    sum += data[c];
            }
        }

        System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);
        System.out.println(&quot;sum = &quot; + sum);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>With a similar but less extreme result.</p>
<hr />
<p>My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache"" rel=""noreferrer"">cache</a>, but then I thought how silly that was because the array was just generated.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is going on?</li>
<li>Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?</li>
</ul>
<p>The code is summing up some independent terms, so the order should not matter.</p>

<ol>
<li>I've done it the easy way, by using the built-in <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html#sqrt(double)"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Math.sqrt()</code></a>
function, but I'm wondering if there is a way to do it faster by
restricting yourself to integer-only domain.</li>
<li>Maintaining a lookup table is impractical (since there are about
2<sup>31.5</sup> integers whose square is less than 2<sup>63</sup>).</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is the very simple and straightforward way I'm doing it now:</p>

<pre><code>public final static boolean isPerfectSquare(long n)
{
  if (n &lt; 0)
    return false;

  long tst = (long)(Math.sqrt(n) + 0.5);
  return tst*tst == n;
}
</code></pre>

<p><sub>Note: I'm using this function in many <a href=""http://projecteuler.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Project Euler</a> problems.  So no one else will ever have to maintain this code.  And this kind of micro-optimization could actually make a difference, since part of the challenge is to do every algorithm in less than a minute, and this function will need to be called millions of times in some problems.</sub></p>

<hr>

<p>I've tried the different solutions to the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>After exhaustive testing, I found that adding <code>0.5</code> to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine.</li>
<li>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root"" rel=""noreferrer"">fast inverse square root</a> was faster, but it gave incorrect results for n >= 410881.  However, as suggested by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/38426/bobbyshaftoe"">BobbyShaftoe</a>, we can use the FISR hack for n &lt; 410881.</li>
<li>Newton's method was a good bit slower than <code>Math.sqrt()</code>.  This is probably because <code>Math.sqrt()</code> uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java.  Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles.</li>
<li>A modified Newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than <code>Math.sqrt()</code>.</li>
<li>Binary chop was even slower.  This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number.</li>
<li>According to John's tests, using <code>or</code> statements is faster in C++ than using a <code>switch</code>, but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between <code>or</code> and <code>switch</code>.</li>
<li>I also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values).  Then instead of either switch or <code>or</code> statement, I would just say <code>if(lookup[(int)(n&amp;0x3F)]) { test } else return false;</code>.  To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower. This is because <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/299079/why-is-this-code-with-several-or-statements-slightly-faster-than-using-a-lookup-t#299205"">array bounds are checked in Java</a>. </li>

This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations.</p>

<p>I also would like only significant digits to be displayed - i.e. there should not be any trailing zeroes.</p>

<p>I know one method of doing this is to use the <code>String.format</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912385);
</code></pre>

<p>returns:</p>

<pre><code>0.91239

<p>which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant: </p>

<pre><code>String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912300);
</code></pre>

<p>returns:</p>

<pre><code>0.91230

<p>returns:</p>

<p>It may be noteworthy to mention this is with Android projects for whatever reason, the method argument values are not always populated, so I have to manually populate them myself. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>Set&lt;String&gt; flavors = new HashSet&lt;String&gt;() {{
    add(""vanilla"");
    add(""strawberry"");
    add(""chocolate"");
    add(""butter pecan"");
}};
</code></pre>

<p>This idiom creates an anonymous inner class with just an instance initializer in it, which ""can use any [...] methods in the containing scope"".  </p>

<p>Main question: Is this as <strong>inefficient</strong> as it sounds?  Should its use be limited to one-off initializations?  (And of course showing off!)</p>

<p>Second question: The new HashSet must be the ""this"" used in the instance initializer ... can anyone shed light on the mechanism?  </p>

<p>Third question: Is this idiom too <strong>obscure</strong> to use in production code?</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Very, very nice answers, thanks everyone. On question (3), people felt the syntax should be clear (though I'd recommend an occasional comment, especially if your code will pass on to developers who may not be familiar with it).  </p>

<p>On question (1), the generated code should run quickly. The extra .class files do cause jar file clutter, and slow program startup slightly (thanks to @coobird for measuring that). @Thilo pointed out that garbage collection can be affected, and the memory cost for the extra loaded classes may be a factor in some cases.  </p>

<p>Question (2) turned out to be most interesting to me. If I understand the answers, what's happening in DBI is that the anonymous inner class extends the class of the object being constructed by the new operator, and hence has a ""this"" value referencing the instance being constructed. Very neat.</p>

<p>Overall, DBI strikes me as something of an intellectual curiousity.  Coobird and others point out you can achieve the same effect with Arrays.asList, varargs methods, Google Collections, and the proposed Java 7 Collection literals.  Newer JVM languages like Scala, JRuby, and Groovy also offer concise notations for list construction, and interoperate well with Java.  Given that DBI clutters up the classpath, slows down class loading a bit, and makes the code a tad more obscure, I'd probably shy away from it. However, I plan to spring this on a friend who's just gotten his SCJP and loves good natured jousts about Java semantics!  ;-)  Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>7/2017: Baeldung <a href=""http://www.baeldung.com/java-double-brace-initialization"" rel=""noreferrer"">has a good summary</a> of double brace initialization and considers it an anti-pattern.</p>

<p>12/2017: @Basil Bourque notes that in the new Java 9 you can say:</p>

<pre><code>Set&lt;String&gt; flavors = Set.of(""vanilla"", ""strawberry"", ""chocolate"", ""butter pecan"");
</code></pre>

<h2>Follow ups from the comments:</h2>

<ul>
<li>The issue appears when compiled with Java 9 or later (we found it in Java 10). Compiling this code on Java 8, then running in Java 9 or any later version, including Java 11 early access, gives the expected result.</li>
<li>This kind of code is non-standard, but is valid according to the spec. It was found by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/1682559/kevin-cruijssen"">Kevin Cruijssen</a> in a <a href=""https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/166012/exchange-capitalization/166081?noredirect=1#comment401670_166081"">discussion in a <strong>golfing challenge</strong></a>, hence the weird use case encountered.</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/525036/didier-l"">Didier L</a> found out that the issue can be reproduced with the much smaller and more understandable code:</p>

<pre><code>class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    array[test()] += ""a"";
  }
  static int test() {

"11677572","1","","","2012-07-26 20:32:59","","738","125683","<p>In my office, the mere mention of the word Xerces is enough to incite murderous rage from developers. A cursory glance at the other Xerces questions on SO seem to indicate that almost all Maven users are &quot;touched&quot; by this problem at some point.  Unfortunately, understanding the problem requires a bit of knowledge about the history of Xerces...</p>
<h1>History</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Xerces is the most widely used XML parser in the Java ecosystem.  Almost every library or framework written in Java uses Xerces in some capacity (transitively, if not directly).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Xerces jars included in the <a href=""http://xerces.apache.org/mirrors.cgi#binary"" rel=""noreferrer"">official binaries</a> are, to this day, not versioned.  For example, the Xerces 2.11.0 implementation jar is named <code>xercesImpl.jar</code> and not <code>xercesImpl-2.11.0.jar</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Xerces team <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESJ-1454?focusedCommentId=12881865&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-12881865"" rel=""noreferrer"">does not use Maven</a>, which means they do not
upload an official release to <a href=""http://search.maven.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Maven Central</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Xerces used to be <a href=""http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/faq-general.html#faq-3"" rel=""noreferrer"">released as a single jar</a> (<code>xerces.jar</code>), but was split into two jars, one containing the API (<code>xml-apis.jar</code>) and one containing the implementations of those APIs (<code>xercesImpl.jar</code>).  Many older Maven POMs still declare a dependency on <code>xerces.jar</code>.  At some point in the past, Xerces was also released as <code>xmlParserAPIs.jar</code>, which some older POMs also depend on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The versions assigned to the xml-apis and xercesImpl jars by those who deploy their jars to Maven repositories are often different.  For example, xml-apis might be given version 1.3.03 and xercesImpl might be given version 2.8.0, even though both are from Xerces 2.8.0.  This is because people often tag the xml-apis jar with the version of the specifications that it implements.  There is a very nice, but incomplete breakdown of this <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20140113103608/http://swordsystems.com/2011/06/29/xerces-and-xml-api-dependency-hell/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To complicate matters, Xerces is the XML parser used in the reference implementation of the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP), included in the JRE. The implementation classes are repackaged under the <code>com.sun.*</code> namespace, which makes it dangerous to access them directly, as they may not be available in some JREs.  However, not all of the Xerces functionality is exposed via the <code>java.*</code> and <code>javax.*</code> APIs; for example, there is no API that exposes Xerces serialization.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adding to the confusing mess, almost all servlet containers (JBoss, Jetty, Glassfish, Tomcat, etc.), ship with Xerces in one or more of their <code>/lib</code> folders.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Problems</h1>
<h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>
<p>For some -- or perhaps all -- of the reasons above, many
organizations publish and consume custom builds of Xerces in their
POMs.  This is not really a problem if you have a small application and are only using Maven Central, but it quickly becomes an issue for enterprise software where Artifactory or Nexus is proxying multiple repositories (JBoss, Hibernate, etc.):</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fe9Xa.png"" alt=""xml-apis proxied by Artifactory"" /></p>
<p>For example, organization A might publish <code>xml-apis</code> as:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.xerces&lt;/groupId&gt;
&lt;artifactId&gt;xml-apis&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;version&gt;2.9.1&lt;/version&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Meanwhile, organization B might publish the same <code>jar</code> as:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;groupId&gt;xml-apis&lt;/groupId&gt;
&lt;artifactId&gt;xml-apis&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;version&gt;1.3.04&lt;/version&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Although B's <code>jar</code> is a lower version than A's <code>jar</code>, Maven does not know
that they are the same artifact because they have different
<code>groupId</code>s. Thus, it cannot perform conflict resolution and both
<code>jar</code>s will be included as resolved dependencies:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4X1ts.png"" alt=""resolved dependencies with multiple xml-apis"" /></p>
<h3>Classloader Hell</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the JRE ships with Xerces in the JAXP RI.  While it would be nice to mark all Xerces Maven dependencies as <code>&lt;exclusion&gt;</code>s or as <code>&lt;provided&gt;</code>, the third-party code you depend on may or may not work with the version provided in JAXP of the JDK you're using.  In addition, you have the Xerces jars shipped in your servlet container to contend with. This leaves you with a number of choices: Do you delete the servlet version and hope that your container runs on the JAXP version? Is it better to leave the servlet version, and hope that your application frameworks run on the servlet version? If one or two of the unresolved conflicts outlined above manage to slip into your product (easy to happen in a large organization), you quickly find yourself in classloader hell, wondering which version of Xerces the classloader is picking at runtime and whether or not it will pick the same jar in Windows and Linux (probably not).</p>
<h1>Solutions?</h1>
<p>We've tried marking all Xerces Maven dependencies as <code>&lt;provided&gt;</code> or as an <code>&lt;exclusion&gt;</code>, but this is difficult to enforce (especially with a large team) given that the artifacts have so many aliases (<code>xml-apis</code>, <code>xerces</code>, <code>xercesImpl</code>, <code>xmlParserAPIs</code>, etc.).  Additionally, our third party libs/frameworks may not run on the JAXP version or the version provided by a servlet container.</p>
<p><strong>How can we best address this problem with Maven?  Do we have to exercise such fine-grained control over our dependencies, and then rely on tiered classloading?  Is there some way to globally exclude all Xerces dependencies, and force all of our frameworks/libs to use the JAXP version?</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Joshua Spiewak has uploaded a patched version of the Xerces build scripts to <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESJ-1454"" rel=""noreferrer"">XERCESJ-1454</a> that allows for upload to Maven Central.  Vote/watch/contribute to this issue and let's fix this problem once and for all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use checked exceptions for
  recoverable conditions and runtime
  exceptions for programming errors
  (Item 58 in 2nd edition)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's see if I understand this correctly.</p>

<p>Here is my understanding of a checked exception:</p>

<pre><code>try{
    String userInput = //read in user input
    Long id = Long.parseLong(userInput);
}catch(NumberFormatException e){
    id = 0; //recover the situation by setting the id to 0
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>1. Is the above considered a checked exception?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Is RuntimeException an unchecked exception?</strong></p>

<p>Here is my understanding of an unchecked exception:</p>

<pre><code>try{
    File file = new File(""my/file/path"");
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);   
}catch(FileNotFoundException e){

//3. What should I do here?
    //Should I ""throw new FileNotFoundException(""File not found"");""?
    //Should I log?
    //Or should I System.exit(0);?
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>4. Now, couldn't the above code also be a checked exception? I can try to recover the situation like this? Can I?</strong> (Note: my 3rd question is inside the <code>catch</code> above)</p>

<pre><code>try{
    String filePath = //read in from user input file path
    File file = new File(filePath);
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);   
}catch(FileNotFoundException e){
    //Kindly prompt the user an error message
    //Somehow ask the user to re-enter the file path.
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>5. Why do people do this?</strong></p>

<pre><code>public void someMethod throws Exception{

}
</code></pre>

<p>Why do they let the exception bubble up? Isn't handling the error sooner better? Why bubble up? </p>

<p><strong>6. Should I bubble up the exact exception or mask it using Exception?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to JuanZe's comment, I found the <a href=""http://www.joda.org/joda-time/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Joda-Time</a> magic, it is also <a href=""http://johannburkard.de/blog/programming/java/date-time-parsing-formatting-joda-time.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">described here</a>.</p>

<p>So, the solution is</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>DateTimeFormatter parser2 = ISODateTimeFormat.dateTimeNoMillis();
String jtdate = ""2010-01-01T12:00:00+01:00"";
System.out.println(parser2.parseDateTime(jtdate));
</code></pre>

<p>Or more simply, use the default parser via the constructor:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>DateTime dt = new DateTime( ""2010-01-01T12:00:00+01:00"" ) ;
</code></pre>

<p>To me, this is nice.</p>

Recently I've developed an application using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groovy_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Groovy</a> and Java. All through the code I wrote used quite a good number of statics. I was asked by the senior technical lot to cut down on the number of statics used. I've googled about the same, and I find that many programmers are fairly against using static variables.</p>

<p>I find static variables more convenient to use. And I presume that they are efficient too (please correct me if I am wrong), because if I had to make 10,000 calls to a function within a class, I would be glad to make the method static and use a straightforward <code>Class.methodCall()</code> on it instead of cluttering the memory with 10,000 instances of the class, right?</p>

<p>Moreover statics reduce the inter-dependencies on the other parts of the code. They can act as perfect state holders. Adding to this I find that statics are widely implemented in some languages like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk"" rel=""noreferrer"">Smalltalk</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Scala</a>.

<blockquote>
  <p>Type safety: Unchecked cast from Object to HashMap</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is from a call to an API that I have no control over which returns Object:</p>

<pre><code>HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; getItems(javax.servlet.http.HttpSession session) {

<p>I'd like to avoid Eclipse warnings, if possible, since theoretically they indicate at least a potential code problem.  I haven't found a good way to eliminate this one yet, though.  I can extract the single line involved out to a method by itself and add <code>@SuppressWarnings(""unchecked"")</code> to that method, thus limiting the impact of having a block of code where I ignore warnings.  Any better options?  I don't want to turn these warnings off in Eclipse.</p>

<p>Before I came to the code, it was simpler, but still provoked warnings:</p>

<pre><code>HashMap getItems(javax.servlet.http.HttpSession session) {
  HashMap theHash = (HashMap)session.getAttribute(""attributeKey"");
  return theHash;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Problem was elsewhere when you tried to use the hash you'd get warnings:</p>

<pre><code>HashMap items = getItems(session);
items.put(""this"", ""that"");

Type safety: The method put(Object, Object) belongs to the raw type HashMap.  References to generic type HashMap&lt;K,V&gt; should be parameterized.

The logs show that both the <code>MileageFeeCalculator</code> bean and the <code>MileageRateService</code> bean are being created, but I get a <code>NullPointerException</code> whenever I try to call the <code>mileageCharge</code> method on my service bean.

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass {
    public MyClass(int x) {}
}

public class MySubClass extends MyClass {
    public MySubClass(int a, int b) {
        int c = a + b;
        super(c);  // COMPILE ERROR
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Sun compiler says ""call to super must be first statement in constructor"". The Eclipse compiler says ""Constructor call must be the first statement in a constructor"".</p>

<p>However, you can get around this by re-arranging the code a little bit:</p>

<pre><code>public class MySubClass extends MyClass {
    public MySubClass(int a, int b) {
        super(a + b);  // OK
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is another example:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass {
    public MyClass(List list) {}
}

public class MySubClassA extends MyClass {
    public MySubClassA(Object item) {
        // Create a list that contains the item, and pass the list to super
        List list = new ArrayList();
        list.add(item);
        super(list);  // COMPILE ERROR
    }
}

public class MySubClassB extends MyClass {
    public MySubClassB(Object item) {
        // Create a list that contains the item, and pass the list to super
        super(Arrays.asList(new Object[] { item }));  // OK
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, it is <strong>not stopping you from executing logic</strong> before the call to super. It is just stopping you from executing logic that you can't fit into a single expression.</p>

<p>There are similar rules for calling <code>this()</code>. The compiler says ""call to this must be first statement in constructor"".</p>

<p>Why does the compiler have these restrictions? Can you give a code example where, if the compiler did not have this restriction, something bad would happen?</p>

<p>To make my question more specific, I am writing an application that deals with data and the specification say that there should be a 'reset' button that brings the application back to its original just launched state. However, all data have to be 'live' unless the application is closed or reset button is pressed.</p>

<p>Being usually a C/C++ programmer, I thought this would be trivial to implement. (And hence I planned to implement it last.) I structured my program such that all the 'reset-able' objects would be in the same class so that I can just destroy all 'live' objects when a reset button is pressed.</p>

<p>I was thinking if all I did was just to dereference the data and wait for the garbage collector to collect them, wouldn't there be a memory leak if my user repeatedly entered data and pressed the reset button? I was also thinking since Java is quite mature as a language, there should be a way to prevent this from happening or gracefully tackle this.</p>

<p>Given a <code>List&lt;E&gt; list</code> object, I know of the following ways to loop through all elements:</p>

<h3>Basic <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.14.1"" rel=""noreferrer"">for</a> <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/for.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">loop</a> (of course, there're equivalent <code>while</code> / <code>do while</code> loops as well)</h3>

<pre><code>// Not recommended (see below)!
for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.size(); i++) {
    E element = list.get(i);
    // 1 - can call methods of element
    // 2 - can use 'i' to make index-based calls to methods of list

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: As @amarseillan pointed out, this form is a poor choice
for iterating over <code>List</code>s, because the actual implementation of
the <code>get</code> method may not be as efficient as when using an <code>Iterator</code>.
For example, <code>LinkedList</code> implementations must traverse all of
the elements preceding i to get the i-th element.</p>

<p>In the above example there's no way for the <code>List</code> implementation to
""save its place"" to make future iterations more efficient. 
For an <code>ArrayList</code> it doesn't really matter, because the complexity/cost of <code>get</code> is constant time (O(1)) whereas for a <code>LinkedList</code> is it proportional to the size of the list (O(n)). </p>

<p>(A map method from Java 8's Stream API (see @i_am_zero's answer).)</p>

<p>In Java 8 collection classes that implement <code>Iterable</code> (for example, all <code>List</code>s) now have a <code>forEach</code> method, which can be used instead of the <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.14.1"" rel=""noreferrer"">for loop statement</a> demonstrated above.

<pre><code>Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4).forEach(System.out::println);
// 1 - can call methods of an element
// 2 - would need reference to containing object to remove an item
//     (TODO: someone please confirm / deny this)
// 3 - functionally separates iteration from the action
//     being performed with each item.

Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4).stream().forEach(System.out::println);
// Same capabilities as above plus potentially greater
// utilization of parallelism
// (caution: consequently, order of execution is not guaranteed,
// see [Stream.forEachOrdered][stream-foreach-ordered] for more
// information about this).

<p>What other ways are there, if any?</p>

<p>Now for the weirdness.  IntelliJ's intention mechanism picks up and recognizes the Logger import in the maven pom file just fine.  However, for all of the hunnysoft imports it reports: ""Cannot resolve symbol 'ByteString/Field/FieldBody'"", <em>BUT</em> Build => Compile 'StackOverflowQuestion.java' compiles everything correctly and the unit test I created for this class runs fine (though the intentions mark the call to create() as a problem area too).</p>

<p>So somewhere, somehow IntelliJ is ignoring the jmime.jar file for the intention subsystem.  I'm confused because the log4j dependency works fine and everything compiles and runs fine.  F12 (""Go To Declaration"") works on the Logger import, but breaks on all the jmime imports.</p>

<p>Oh, one other thing, if I go to the 'Packages' view in the ""Projects"" window the ""com.hunnysoft.jmime"" package appears and I can see ALL of the classes I imported in the code snippet above under ""Libraries"".  Removing the above dependency from the pom.xml file causes this package to disappear and the compilation breaks.</p>

<p>It appears that the inspection's classpath is broken, but there does not seem to be a setting for this anywhere in the Settings => Intentions | Compiler areas (not that I expected any such settings, I believe the IDEA should already know the correct classpath based on the pom file and JDK).</p>

<p>As a final experiment I created a brand new standard J2SE application project (without using maven) and added the jmime.jar file directly to the project as one of its libraries.  I run into exactly the same problems as described above in this new project.</p>

<p>Here is the MANIFEST.MF from the jmime jar file.</p>

<pre><code>Manifest-Version: 1.0
Ant-Version: Apache Ant 1.5.4
Created-By: 10.0-b23 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)

Name: com/hunnysoft/jmime/
Sealed: true

</code></pre>

<p>I don't see anything unusual in this jar file.</p>

<p>My best guess is that perhaps the problem might be a missing dependency issue.  But AFAIK jmime is supposed to be self contained (JarAnalyzer doesn't come up with anything, but I'm not sure it would if a dependency jar is missing).</p>

<p>So, anyone have any IDEAs?</p>

<h3>Added June 18, 2013</h3>

<p>Since there was no answer and could not find such benchmarks done by others, decided to do my own tests. Unfortunately, my question remains ""locked"" so I cannot post this as the answer, only edit the question. Please vote to re-open this question. For C#, I used Xamarin.Android Ver. 4.7.09001 (beta). The source code, all the data I used for testing and compiled APK packages are on GitHub:</p>

<p>Java: <a href=""https://github.com/gregko/TtsSetup_Java"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/gregko/TtsSetup_Java</a></p>

<p>If someone would like to repeat my tests on other devices or emulators, I'd be interested to learn the results as well.</p>

<h1>Results from my testing</h1>

<p>I ported my sentence extractor class to C# (from my @Voice Aloud Reader app) and run some tests on 10 HTML files in English, Russian, French, Polish and Czech languages. Each run was performed 5 times on all 10 files, and the total time for 3 different devices and one emulator are posted below. I tested ""Release"" builds only, without debugging enabled.</p>

<h3>HTC Nexus One Android 2.3.7 (API 10) - CyanogenMod ROM</h3>

<p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 12361 ms, with file reading total: 13304 ms</p>

<p>C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 17504 ms, with file reading total: 17956 ms</p>

<p>C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 44136 ms, with file reading total: 45109 ms</p>

<h1>Brief discussion</h1>

<p>My test code contains mainly text parsing, replacing and Regex searches, perhaps for other code (e.g. more numeric operations) the results would be different. On all devices with ARM processors, Java performed better than Xamarin C# code. The largest difference was under Android 2.3, where C# code run at approx. 70% of Java speed.</p>

<p>On Intel emulator (with Intel HAX technology, emulator runs in fast virt mode), Xamarin C# code runs my sample code much faster than Java - about 1.35 time faster. Maybe Mono virtual machine code and libraries are much better optimized on Intel than on ARM?</p>

<h1>Edit July 8, 2013</h1>

<p>I just installed Genymotion Android emulator, which runs in Oracle VirtualBox, and again this one uses native Intel processor, not emulating ARM processor. As with Intel HAX emulator, again C# runs here much faster. Here are my results:</p>

<h3>Genymotion emulator - Intel (Android 4.1.1, API 16)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Java:
  Grand total time (5 runs): 2069 ms, with file reading total: 2248 ms</p>
  
  <p>C#:
  Grand total time (5 runs): 1543 ms, with file reading total: 1642 ms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I then noticed that there was an update to Xamarin.Android beta, version 4.7.11, with release notes mentioning some changes in Mono runtime as well. Decided to quickly test some ARM devices, and big surprise - C# numbers improved:</p>

<h3>BN Nook XD+, ARM (Android 4.0)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 8103 ms, with file reading total: 8569 ms</p>
  
  <p>C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 7951 ms, with file reading total: 8161 ms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow! C# is now better than Java? Decided to repeat the test on my Galaxy Note 2:</p>

<h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - ARM (Android 4.1.1)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 9675 ms, with file reading total: 10028 ms</p>
  
  <p>C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 9911 ms, with file reading total: 10104 ms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here C# seems to be only slightly slower, but these numbers gave me a pause: Why the time is longer than on Nook HD+, even though Note 2 has a faster processor? The answer: power saving mode. On Nook, it was disabled, on Note 2 - enabled. Decided to test with power saving mode disabled (as with enabled, it also limits the processor speed):</p>

<h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - ARM (Android 4.1.1), power saving disabled</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 7153 ms, with file reading total: 7459 ms</p>
  
  <p>C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 6906 ms, with file reading total: 7070 ms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, surprisingly, C# is slightly faster than Java on ARM processor as well. Big improvement!</p>

<h1>Edit July 12, 2013</h1>

<p>We all know, that nothing beats native code for speed, and I was not satisfied with the performance of my sentence splitter in Java or C#, particularly that I need to improve it (and thus make it even slower). Decided to re-write it in C++. Here is a small (i.e. a smaller set of files than previous tests, for other reasons) comparison of the speed of native vs. Java on my Galaxy Note 2, with power saving mode disabled:</p>

<p>Java:
Grand total time (5 runs): 3292 ms, with file reading total: 3454 ms</p>

<p>Native thumb:
Grand total time (5 runs): 537 ms, with file reading total: 657 ms</p>

<p>Native arm:
Grand total time (5 runs): 458 ms, with file reading total: 587 ms</p>

<p>Looks like for my particular test, the native code is 6 to 7 times faster than Java. Caveat: could not use std::regex class on Android, so had to write my own specialized routines searching for paragraphs breaks or html tags. My initial tests of the same code on a PC using regex, were about 4 to 5 times faster than Java.</p>

<p>Phew! Waking raw memory with char* or wchar* pointers again, I instantly felt 20 years younger! :)</p>

<h1>Edit July 15, 2013</h1>

<p><strong><em>(Please see below, with edits of 7/30/2013, for much better results with Dot42)</em></strong></p>

<p>With some difficulty, I managed to port my C# tests to Dot42 (version 1.0.1.71 beta), another C# platform for Android. Preliminary results show that Dot42 code is about 3x (3 times) slower than Xamarin C# (v. 4.7.11), on an Intel Android emulator. One problem is that System.Text.RegularExpressions class in Dot42 does not have the Split() function that I used in Xamarin tests, so I used Java.Util.Regex class instead, and Java.Util.Regex.Pattern.Split(), so in this particular place in the code, there is this small difference. Should not be a big problem though. Dot42 compiles to Dalvik (DEX) code, so it cooperates with Java on Android natively, does not need expensive interop from C# to Java like Xamarin.</p>

<p>Just for comparison, I also run the test on ARM devices - here the Dot42 code is ""only"" 2x slower than Xamarin C#. Here are my results:</p>

<h3>HTC Nexus One Android 2.3.7 (ARM)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 12187 ms, with file reading total: 13200 ms</p>
  
  <p>Xamarin C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 13935 ms, with file reading total: 14465 ms</p>
  
  <p>Dot42 C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 26000 ms, with file reading total: 27168 ms</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 2, Android 4.1.1 (ARM)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 6895 ms, with file reading total: 7275 ms</p>
  
  <p>Xamarin C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 6466 ms, with file reading total: 6720 ms</p>
  
  <p>Dot42 C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 11185 ms, with file reading total: 11843 ms</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Intel emulator, Android 4.2 (x86)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 2389 ms, with file reading total: 2770 ms</p>
  
  <p>Xamarin C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 1748 ms, with file reading total: 1933 ms</p>
  
  <p>Dot42 C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 5150 ms, with file reading total: 5459 ms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me, it was also interesting to note that Xamarin C# is slightly faster than Java on a newer ARM device and slightly slower on the old Nexus One. If anyone would like to run these tests as well, please let me know and I'll update the sources on GitHub. It would be particularly interesting to see results from a real Android device with Intel processor.</p>

<h2>Update 7/26/2013</h2>

<p>Just a quick update, re-compiled by benchmark apps with the latest Xamarin.Android 4.8, and also with dot42 1.0.1.72 update released today - no significant changes from the results reported before.</p>

<h2>Update 7/30/2013 - better results for dot42</h2>

<p>Re-tested Dot42 with Robert's (from dot42 makers) port of my Java code to C#. In my C# port done initially for Xamarin, I replaced some native Java classes, like ListArray, with List class native to C#, etc. Robert did not have my Dot42 source code, so he ported it again from Java and used original Java classes in such places, which benefits Dot42, I guess because it runs in Dalvik VM, like Java, and not in Mono, like Xamarin. Now Dot42 results are much better. Here is a log from my testing:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I still think that Dot42 has a long way to go. Having Java-like classes (e.g. ArrayList) and a good performance with them would make porting code from Java to C# slightly easier. However, this is something I would not be likely to do a lot. I would rather want to use existing C# code (libraries etc.), which will use native C# classes (e.g. List), and that would perform slowly with the current dot42 code, and very well with Xamarin.</p>

<p>Conventional wisdom, as well as a lot of Google results, says that exceptional logic shouldn't be used for normal program flow in Java.  Two reasons are usually given,</p>

<ol>
<li>it is really slow - even an order of magnitude slower than regular code (the reasons given vary),  </li>
</ol>

<p>and </p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>it is messy because people expect only errors to be handled in exceptional code.  </li>
</ol>

<p>This question is about #1.</p>

<p>As an example, <a href=""http://leepoint.net/notes-java/flow/exceptions/03exceptions.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this page</a> describes Java exception handling as ""very slow"" and relates the slowness to the creation of the exception message string - ""this string is then used in creating the exception object that is thrown. This is not fast.""  The article <a href=""http://adtmag.com/articles/2000/08/22/effective-exception-handling-in-java.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Effective Exception Handling in Java</a> says that ""the reason for this is due to the object creation aspect of exception handling, which thereby makes throwing exceptions inherently slow"".  Another reason out there is that the stack trace generation is what slows it down.</p>

<p>My testing (using Java 1.6.0_07, Java HotSpot 10.0, on 32 bit Linux), indicates that exception handling is no slower than regular code.  I tried running a method in a loop that executes some code.  At the end of the method, I use a boolean to indicate whether to <em>return</em> or <em>throw</em>.  This way the actual processing is the same. I tried running the methods in different orders and averaging my test times, thinking it may have been the JVM warming up.  In all my tests, the throw was at least as fast as the return, if not faster (up to 3.1% faster).  I am completely open to the possibility that my tests were wrong, but I haven't seen anything out there in the way of the code sample, test comparisons, or results in the last year or two that show exception handling in Java to actually be slow.</p>

<p>What leads me down this path was an API I needed to use that threw exceptions as part of normal control logic.  I wanted to correct them in their usage, but now I may not be able to.  Will I instead have to praise them on their forward thinking?</p>

<p>In the paper <a href=""http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=337453"" rel=""noreferrer"">Efficient Java exception handling in just-in-time compilation</a>, the authors suggest that the presence of exception handlers alone, even if no exceptions are thrown, is enough to prevent the JIT compiler from optimizing the code properly, thus slowing it down.  I haven't tested this theory yet.</p>

<p>I've broken the SQL statements semantically into several concatenated strings over several lines of code for ease of maintenance. So instead of something like:</p>

<pre><code>String query = ""SELECT FOO, BAR, BAZ FROM ABC WHERE BAR &gt; 4"";
</code></pre>

<p>I have something like:</p>

<pre><code>String query =
    ""SELECT FOO, BAR, BAZ"" +
    ""  FROM ABC          "" +
    "" WHERE BAR &gt; 4      "";
</code></pre>

<p>This style makes the SQL much easier to read and maintain (IMHO), especially for larger queries. For example, I can put my editor into ""overwrite"" mode and modify the text in-place fairly easily.</p>

<p><strong>Note that this issue generalizes beyond the particular example of SQL. Any code that is written with any vertical formatting, particularly tabular constructs, is susceptible to destruction by a pretty printer.</strong></p>

<p>Now, some project members use the Eclipse editor and the semantic formatting is often destroyed when they format an entire source file.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to instruct Eclipse to ignore certain lines of source with respect to formatting?</strong></p>

<p>I'm looking for something like a special comment that toggles the Eclipse formatter. Ideally, such a comment could be configurable to be whatever we choose, and other formatters could be programmed to respect it as well:</p>

<pre><code>// STOP-ECLIPSE-FORMATTING
String query =
    ""SELECT FOO, BAR, BAZ"" +
    ""  FROM ABC          "" +
    "" WHERE BAR &gt; 4      "";
// START-ECLIPSE-FORMATTING
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, one ""solution"" is to have our team members standardize on some external formatter like <a href=""http://www.triemax.com/products/jalopy/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jalopy</a> or <a href=""http://www.jindent.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">JIndent</a>, but that's not what this question is about (also, not my decision on this project): I'm specifically looking for a way to avoid the Eclipse formatter on an ad-hoc basis.</p>

<p>Ideally, a solution will allow me to insert instructions for the Eclipse formatter <strong>without requiring team members using Eclipse to do any IDE reconfiguration</strong> (other than possibly choosing a formatter agnostic command comment: <code>STOP-ECLIPSE-FORMATTING</code> &rarr; <code>STOP-FORMATTING</code>).</p>

<li>What exactly are the negative consequences of using those methods? (I can only think adding portability between systems with different screen resolution).</li>
<li>I don't think any LayoutManager can exactly satisfy all desired layout needs. Do I really need to implement a new LayoutManager for every little variation on my layout ? </li>
<li>If the answer to 4 is ""yes"", won't this lead to a proliferation of LayoutManager classes which will become difficult to maintain?</li>
<li>In a situation where I need to define proportions between children of a Component (eg, child1 should use 10% of space, child2 40% ,child3 50%), is it possible to achieve that without implementing a custom LayoutManager?</li>

<p>OK, the problem I have is that another ""parent"" entity is inside my parent, my real behavior is this:</p>

<p>Hibernate doesn't like two collections with <code>FetchType.EAGER</code>, but this seems to be a bug, I'm not doing unusual things...</p>

<p>Removing <code>FetchType.EAGER</code> from <code>Parent</code> or <code>AnotherParent</code> solves the problem, but I need it, so real solution is to use <code>@LazyCollection(LazyCollectionOption.FALSE)</code> instead of <code>FetchType</code> (thanks to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/203907/bozho"">Bozho</a> for the solution).</p>

<p>Here's my response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Methods of a Java interface are implicitly abstract
   and cannot have implementations. A Java abstract class can have
   instance methods that implements a default behaviour.</p>
  
  <p>Variables declared in a Java interface are by default final. An 
   abstract class may contain non-final variables.</p>
  
  <p>Members of a Java interface are public by default. A Java abstract
   class can have the usual flavours of class members like private,
   protected, etc.</p>
  
  <p>A Java interface should be implemented using keyword “implements”; A
  Java abstract class should be extended using keyword “extends”.</p>
  
  <p>An interface can extend another Java interface only, an abstract class
   can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.</p>
  
  <p>A Java class can implement multiple interfaces but it can extend only
   one abstract class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the interviewer was not satisfied, and told me that this description represented ""<em>bookish knowledge</em>"".</p>

<p>He asked me for a more practical response, explaining <em>when I would choose an abstract class over an interface, using practical examples</em>.</p>

"613954","1","","","2009-03-05 08:18:54","","461","56961","<p>For a number of years now I have been unable to get a decent answer to the following question: why are some developers so against checked exceptions?  I have had numerous conversations, read things on blogs, read what Bruce Eckel had to say (the first person I saw speak out against them).</p>
<p>I am currently writing some new code and paying very careful attention to how I deal with exceptions.  I am trying to see the point of view of the &quot;we don't like checked exceptions&quot; crowd and I still cannot see it.</p>
<p>Every conversation I have ends with the same question going unanswered... let me set it up:</p>
<p>In general (from how Java was designed),</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Error</code> is for things that should never be caught (VM has a peanut allergy and someone dropped a jar of peanuts on it)</li>
<li><code>RuntimeException</code> is for things that the programmer did wrong (programmer walked off the end of an array)</li>
<li><code>Exception</code> (except <code>RuntimeException</code>) is for things that are out of the programmer's control (disk fills up while writing to the file system, file handle limit for the process has been reached and you cannot open any more files)</li>
<li><code>Throwable</code> is simply the parent of all of the exception types.</li>
</ul>
<p>A common argument I hear is that if an exception happens then all the developer is going to do is exit the program.</p>
<p>Another common argument I hear is that checked exceptions make it harder to refactor code.</p>
<p>For the &quot;all I am going to do is exit&quot; argument I say that even if you are exiting you need to display a reasonable error message.  If you are just punting on handling errors then your users won't be overly happy when the program exits without a clear indication of why.</p>
<p>For the &quot;it makes it hard to refactor&quot; crowd, that indicates that the proper level of abstraction wasn't chosen.  Rather than declare a method throws an <code>IOException</code>, the <code>IOException</code> should be transformed into an exception that is more suited for what is going on.</p>
<p>I don't have an issue with wrapping Main with <code>catch(Exception)</code> (or in some cases <code>catch(Throwable)</code> to ensure that the program can exit gracefully - but I always catch the specific exceptions I need to.  Doing that allows me to, at the very least, display an appropriate error message.</p>
<p>The question that people never reply to is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you throw <code>RuntimeException</code>
subclasses instead of <code>Exception</code>
subclasses then how do you know what
you are supposed to catch?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the answer is catch <code>Exception</code> then you are also dealing with programmer errors the same way as system exceptions.  That seems wrong to me.</p>
<p>If you catch <code>Throwable</code> then you are treating system exceptions and VM errors (and the like) the same way.  That seems wrong to me.</p>
<p>If the answer is that you catch only the exceptions you know are thrown then how do you know what ones are thrown?  What happens when programmer X throws a new exception and forgot to catch it?  That seems very dangerous to me.</p>
<p>I would say that a program that displays a stack trace is wrong.  Do people who don't like checked exceptions not feel that way?</p>
<p>So, if you don't like checked exceptions can you explain why not AND answer the question that doesn't get answered please?</p>
<p>I am not looking for advice on when to use either model, what I am looking for is <em>why</em> people extend from <code>RuntimeException</code> because they don't like extending from <code>Exception</code> and/or why they catch an exception and then rethrow a <code>RuntimeException</code> rather than add throws to their method.  I want to understand the motivation for disliking checked exceptions.</p>

<p>but then I get an error in eclipse saying ""The type new List(){} must implement the inherited abstract method..."" and if I use a quick fix I get a monster of over 20 method stubs. </p>

<p>I am pretty sure that there is an easier solution, but I seem unable to find it!</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Now I have </p>

<pre><code>Type listType = new TypeToken&lt;List&lt;MyClass&gt;&gt;()
                {
                }.getType();

MyClass mc = new Gson().fromJson(result, listType);
</code></pre>

<p>However, I do get the following exception at the ""fromJson"" line:</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.NullPointerException

</code></pre>

<p>I <em>do</em> catch JsonParseExceptions and ""result"" is not null.</p>

<p>I checked listType with the debugger and got the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>list Type 

<ul>
<li>args = ListOfTypes

<ul>
<li>list = null</li>
<li>resolvedTypes = Type[ 1 ]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>loader = PathClassLoader</li>
<li>ownerType0 = null</li>
<li>ownerTypeRes = null</li>
<li>rawType = Class (java.util.ArrayList)</li>
<li>rawTypeName = ""java.util.ArrayList""</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>so it seems the ""getClass"" invocation didn't work properly. Any suggestions...?</p>

<p>Edit2:
I'v checked on the <a href=""http://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-user-guide#TOC-Serializing-and-Deserializing-Gener"" rel=""noreferrer"">Gson User Guide</a>. It mentions a Runtime Exception that should happen during parsing a generic type to Json. I did it ""wrong"" (not shown above), just as in the example, but didn't get that exception at all. So I changed the serialization as in the user guide suggested. Didn't help, though.</p>

<p>Edit3: 
Solved, see my answer below.</p>

<p>Here is the original issue.</p>

<p>I am getting this error:</p>

<p>I am using Tomcat 6 as webserver. I have two HTTPS web applications installed on different Tomcats on different ports but on the same machine. Say <code>App1(port 8443)</code> and 
 <code>App2(port 443)</code>. <code>App1</code> connects to <code>App2</code>. When <code>App1</code> connects to <code>App2</code> I get the above error. I know this is a very common error so came across many solutions on different forums and sites. I have the below entry in <code>server.xml</code> of both Tomcats:</p>

<pre><code>keystoreFile=""c:/.keystore"" 
keystorePass=""changeit""
</code></pre>

<p>Every site says the same reason that certificate given by app2 is not in the trusted store of app1 jvm. This seems to be true also when I tried to hit the same URL in IE browser, it works (with warming, There is a problem with this web site's security certificate. Here I say continue to this website). But when same URL is hit by Java client (in my case) I get the above error. So to put it in the truststore I tried these three options:</p>

<p><strong>Option1</strong></p>

<pre><code>System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"", ""C:/.keystore"");
System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword"", ""changeit"");
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Option2</strong>
Setting below in environment variable</p>

<pre><code>CATALINA_OPTS -- param name
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=C:\.keystore -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit ---param value
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Option3</strong>
Setting below in environment variable</p>

<pre><code>JAVA_OPTS -- param name
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=C:\.keystore -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit ---param value
</code></pre>

<p><strong>But nothing worked</strong> .</p>

<p><strong>What at last worked</strong>   is executing the Java approach suggested in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1828775/httpclient-and-ssl"">How to handle invalid SSL certificates with Apache HttpClient?</a> by Pascal Thivent i.e. executing the program InstallCert. </p>

<p><strong>But this approach is fine for devbox setup but I can not use it at production environment.</strong> </p>

<p>I am wondering
why three approaches mentioned above did not work when I have mentioned the same values in <code>server.xml</code> of <code>app2</code> server and same values in truststore by setting</p>

<p><code>System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"", ""C:/.keystore"") and System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword"", ""changeit"");</code></p>

<p>in <code>app1</code> program.</p>

<p>For more information this is how I am making the connection:</p>

<pre><code>URL url = new URL(urlStr);

URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();

if (conn instanceof HttpsURLConnection) {

  HttpsURLConnection conn1 = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();

  conn1.setHostnameVerifier(new HostnameVerifier() {
    public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) {
      return true;
    }
  });

  reply.load(conn1.getInputStream());

<p>and each Node points to the next node, except for the last Node, which has null for next.  Say there is a possibility that the list can contain a loop - i.e. the final Node, instead of having a null, has a reference to one of the nodes in the list which came before it.</p>

<p>What's the best way of writing</p>

<pre><code>boolean hasLoop(Node first)
</code></pre>

<p>which would return <code>true</code> if the given Node is the first of a list with a loop, and <code>false</code> otherwise?  How could you write so that it takes a constant amount of space and a reasonable amount of time?</p>

So I decided to try and find out the general best practice for each issue and write this down for personal use.<br>
I would not mind however for anyone to comment on it or to tell me where I'm wrong.</p>

<h2>Entity Class</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>implement Serializable  </p>

<p>Reason: <em>The specification says you have to, but some JPA providers do not enforce this. Hibernate as JPA provider does not enforce this, but it can fail somewhere deep in its stomach with ClassCastException, if Serializable has not been implemented.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Constructors</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>create a constructor with all required fields of the entity </p>

<p><em>Reason: A constructor should always leave the instance created in a sane state.</em>  </p></li>
<li><p>besides this constructor: have a package private default constructor  </p>

<p><em>Reason: Default constructor is required to have Hibernate initialize the entity; private is allowed but package private (or public) visibility is required for runtime proxy generation and efficient data retrieval without bytecode instrumentation.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Fields/Properties</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Use field access in general and property access when needed  </p>

<p><em>Reason:  this is probably the most debatable issue since there are no clear and convincing  arguments for one or the other (property access vs field access); however, field access seems to be general favourite because of clearer code, better encapsulation and no need to create setters for immutable fields</em> </p></li>
<li><p>Omit setters for immutable fields (not required for access type field)</p></li>
<li>properties may be private<br>
Reason: I once heard that protected is better for (Hibernate) performance but all I can find on the web is: <em>Hibernate can access public, private, and protected accessor methods, as well as public, private and protected fields directly. The choice is up to you and you can match it to fit your application design.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Equals/hashCode</h2>

<ul>
<li>Never use a generated id if this id is only set when persisting the entity</li>
<li>By preference: use immutable values to form a unique Business Key and use this to test equality</li>
<li>if a unique Business Key is not available use a non-transient <strong>UUID</strong> which is created when the entity is initialised; See <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20171211235806/http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2006/09/13/dont-let-hibernate-steal-your-identity.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this great article</a> for more information.</li>
<li><strong>never</strong> refer to related entities (ManyToOne); if this entity (like a parent entity) needs to be part of the Business Key then compare the ID's only. Calling getId() on a proxy will not trigger the loading of the entity, as long as you're using <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3736818/hibernate-generating-sql-queries-when-accessing-associated-entitys-id/3739197#3739197"">property access type</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Entity</h2>

<pre><code>@Entity
@Table(name = ""ROOM"")
public class Room implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    @Column(name = ""room_id"")
    private Integer id;

    @Column(name = ""number"") 
    private String number; //immutable

    @Column(name = ""capacity"")
    private Integer capacity;

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, optional = false)
    @JoinColumn(name = ""building_id"")
    private Building building; //immutable

    Room() {
        // default constructor
    }

    public Room(Building building, String number) {
        // constructor with required field
        notNull(building, ""Method called with null parameter (application)"");
        notNull(number, ""Method called with null parameter (name)"");

        this.building = building;
        this.number = number;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(final Object otherObj) {
        if ((otherObj == null) || !(otherObj instanceof Room)) {
            return false;
        }
        // a room can be uniquely identified by it's number and the building it belongs to; normally I would use a UUID in any case but this is just to illustrate the usage of getId()
        final Room other = (Room) otherObj;
        return new EqualsBuilder().append(getNumber(), other.getNumber())
                .append(getBuilding().getId(), other.getBuilding().getId())
                .isEquals();
        //this assumes that Building.id is annotated with @Access(value = AccessType.PROPERTY) 
    }

    public Building getBuilding() {
        return building;
    }


    public Integer getId() {
        return id;
    }

        return number;
    }

    @Override

Recently, I am running into <code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space</code> error because I am not being conservative on memory usage. The user can open unlimited number of files, and the program keeps the opened objects in the memory. After a quick research I found <a href=""http://java.sun.com/docs/hotspot/gc5.0/ergo5.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ergonomics in the 5.0 Java Virtual Machine</a> and others saying on Windows machine the JVM defaults max heap size as <code>64MB</code>.</p>

<p>Given this situation, how should I deal with this constraint?</p>

<p>I could increase the <strong>max heap size</strong> using <strong>command line</strong> option to java, but that would require figuring out available RAM and writing some launching program or script. Besides, increasing to some <strong>finite</strong> max does not <strong>ultimately</strong> get rid of the issue.</p>

<p>I could rewrite some of my code to persist objects to file system frequently (using database is the same thing) to free up the memory. It could work, but it's probably a lot work too.</p>

<p>If you could point me to details of above ideas or some alternatives like <strong>automatic virtual memory, extending heap size dynamically</strong>, that will be great.</p>

"31922866","1","31923105","","2015-08-10 14:58:00","","421","159630","<p>I've read on many Web sites Optional should be used as a return type only, and not used in method arguments.  I'm struggling to find a logical reason why.  For example I have a piece of logic which has 2 optional parameters.  Therefore I think it would make sense to write my method signature like this (solution 1):</p>

<pre><code>public int calculateSomething(Optional&lt;String&gt; p1, Optional&lt;BigDecimal&gt; p2 {
    // my logic
}
</code></pre>

<p>Many web pages specify Optional should not be used as method arguments. With this in mind, I could use the following method signature and add a clear Javadoc comment to specify that the arguments may be null, hoping future maintainers will read the Javadoc and therefore always carry out null checks prior to using the arguments (solution 2):</p>

<pre><code>public int calculateSomething(String p1, BigDecimal p2) {
    // my logic
}
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively I could replace my method with four public methods to provide a nicer interface and make it more obvious p1 and p2 are optional (solution 3):</p>

<pre><code>public int calculateSomething() {
    calculateSomething(null, null);
}

public int calculateSomething(String p1) {
    calculateSomething(p1, null);
}

public int calculateSomething(BigDecimal p2) {
    calculateSomething(null, p2);
}

public int calculateSomething(String p1, BigDecimal p2) {
    // my logic
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I try writing the code of the class which invokes this piece of logic for each approach.  I first retrieve the two input parameters from another object which returns <code>Optional</code>s and then, I invoke <code>calculateSomething</code>.  Therefore, if solution 1 is used the calling code would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Optional&lt;String&gt; p1 = otherObject.getP1();
Optional&lt;BigInteger&gt; p2 = otherObject.getP2();
int result = myObject.calculateSomething(p1, p2);
</code></pre>

<p>if solution 2 is used, the calling code would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Optional&lt;String&gt; p1 = otherObject.getP1();
Optional&lt;BigInteger&gt; p2 = otherObject.getP2();
int result = myObject.calculateSomething(p1.orElse(null), p2.orElse(null));
</code></pre>

<p>if solution 3 is applied, I could use the code above or I could use the following (but it's significantly more code):</p>

<pre><code>Optional&lt;String&gt; p1 = otherObject.getP1();
Optional&lt;BigInteger&gt; p2 = otherObject.getP2();
int result;
if (p1.isPresent()) {
    if (p2.isPresent()) {
        result = myObject.calculateSomething(p1, p2);
    } else {
        result = myObject.calculateSomething(p1);
    }
} else {
    if (p2.isPresent()) {
        result = myObject.calculateSomething(p2);
    } else {
        result = myObject.calculateSomething();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>So my question is: Why is it considered bad practice to use <code>Optional</code>s as method arguments (see solution 1)?</strong>  It looks like the most readable solution to me and makes it most obvious that the parameters could be empty/null to future maintainers.  (I'm aware the designers of <code>Optional</code> intended it to only be used as a return type, but I can't find any logical reasons not to use it in this scenario).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GpJoM.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GpJoM.png"" alt=""Graph of a or b non-zero"" /></a></p>
<p>We do see the same effect of branch prediction as expected, interestingly the graph is somewhat flipped along the X-axis.</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>1- I added <code>!(a==0 || b==0)</code> to the analysis to see what happens.</p>
<p>2- I also included <code>a != 0 || b != 0</code>, <code>(a+b) != 0</code> and <code>(a|b) != 0</code> out of curiosity, after learning about branch prediction. But they are not logically equivalent to the other expressions, because only a <em>OR</em> b needs to be non-zero to return true, so they are not meant to be compared for processing efficiency.</p>
<p>3- I also added the actual benchmark that I used for the analysis, which is just iterating an arbitrary int variable.</p>
<p>4- Some people were suggesting to include <code>a != 0 &amp; b != 0</code> as opposed to <code>a != 0 &amp;&amp; b != 0</code>, with the prediction that it would behave more closely to <code>a*b != 0</code> because we would remove the branch prediction effect. I didn't know that <code>&amp;</code> could be used with boolean variables, I thought it was only used for binary operations with integers.</p>
<p>Note: In the context that I was considering all this, int overflow is not an issue, but that's definitely an important consideration in general contexts.</p>

So I copied <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/math/BigInteger.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>java.math.BigInteger</code></a> source into my own package and tried this:</p>

<pre><code>//import java.math.BigInteger;

public class MultiplyTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random r = new Random(1);
        long tm = 0, count = 0,result=0;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 400000; i++) {
            int s1 = 400, s2 = 400;
            BigInteger a = new BigInteger(s1 * 8, r), b = new BigInteger(s2 * 8, r);
            long tm1 = System.nanoTime();
            BigInteger c = a.multiply(b);
            if (i &gt; 100000) {
                tm += System.nanoTime() - tm1;
                count++;
            }
            result+=c.bitLength();
        }
        System.out.println((tm / count) + ""nsec/mul"");
        System.out.println(result); 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I run this (jdk 1.8.0_144-b01 on MacOS) it outputs:</p>

<pre><code>12089nsec/mul
2559044166
</code></pre>

<p>When I run it with the import line uncommented:</p>

<pre><code>4098nsec/mul
2559044166
</code></pre>

<p>It's almost three times as fast when using the JDK version of BigInteger versus my version, even if it's using the exact same code.</p>

<p>I've examined the bytecode with javap, and compared compiler output when running with options:</p>

<pre><code>-Xbatch -XX:-TieredCompilation -XX:+PrintCompilation -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions 
-XX:+PrintInlining -XX:CICompilerCount=1
</code></pre>

<p>and both versions seem to generate the same code.
So is hotspot using some precomputed optimisations that I can't use in my code? I always understood that they don't.
What explains this difference?</p>

<p>Imagine that I have a server application and I would like to use parallel streams. But the application is large and multi-threaded so I want to compartmentalize it. I do not want a slow running task in one module of the applicationblock tasks from another module.</p>

<p>If I can not use different thread pools for different modules, it means I can not safely use parallel streams in most of real world situations.</p>

<p>Try the following example. There are some CPU intensive tasks executed in separate threads.
The tasks leverage parallel streams. The first task is broken, so each step takes 1 second (simulated by thread sleep). The issue is that other threads get stuck and wait for the broken task to finish. This is contrived example, but imagine a servlet app and someone submitting a long running task to the shared fork join pool. </p>

        trusted.load(null, """".toCharArray());
        SSLSocketFactory sslf = new SSLSocketFactory(trusted);
        sslf.setHostnameVerifier(SSLSocketFactory.ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER);

        SchemeRegistry schemeRegistry = new SchemeRegistry();
        schemeRegistry.register(new Scheme (""https"", sslf, 443));
        SingleClientConnManager cm = new SingleClientConnManager(post.getParams(),

        HttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient(cm, post.getParams());

java.sql.SQLException: The server timezone value 'UTC' is unrecognized or represents more than one timezone. You must configure either the server or JDBC driver (via the serverTimezone configuration property) to use a more specifc timezone value if you want to utilize timezone support.

<p>Say I'm creating a word frequency list, using a Map (probably a HashMap), where each key is a String with the word that's being counted and the value is an Integer that's incremented each time a token of the word is found.</p>

<p>In Perl, incrementing such a value would be trivially easy:</p>

<pre><code>$map{$word}++;
</code></pre>

<p>But in Java, it's much more complicated. Here the way I'm currently doing it:</p>

<pre><code>int count = map.containsKey(word) ? map.get(word) : 0;
map.put(word, count + 1);
</code></pre>

<p>Which of course relies on the autoboxing feature in the newer Java versions. I wonder if you can suggest a more efficient way of incrementing such a value. Are there even good performance reasons for eschewing the Collections framework and using a something else instead?</p>

<p>Update: I've done a test of several of the answers. See below.</p>

Instead, they claim, a lock on a private reference is to be preferred.</p>

<p>Some of the given reasons are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/416183/in-java-critical-sections-what-should-i-synchronize-on#416198"">some <em>evil code</em> may steal your lock</a> (very popular this one, also has an ""accidentally"" variant)</li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/309631/what-cases-require-synchronized-method-access-in-java#309677"">all synchronized methods within the same class use the exact same lock, which reduces throughput</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/439302/allowing-a-method-to-lock-its-parent-object-in-java#439317"">you are (unnecessarily) exposing too much information</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Other people, including me, argue that <code>synchronized(this)</code> is an idiom that is used a lot (also in Java libraries), is safe and well understood. It should not be avoided because you have a bug and you don't have a clue of what is going on in your multithreaded program. In other words: if it is applicable, then use it.</p>

<p>I am interested in seeing some real-world examples (no foobar stuff) where avoiding a lock on <code>this</code> is preferable when <code>synchronized(this)</code> would also do the job.</p>

<p>Therefore: <strong>should you always avoid <code>synchronized(this)</code> and replace it with a lock on a private reference?</strong>  </p>

<hr>

<p>Some further info (updated as answers are given):</p>

<ul>
<li>we are talking about instance synchronization</li>
<li>both implicit (<code>synchronized</code> methods) and explicit form of <code>synchronized(this)</code> are considered</li>
<li>if you quote Bloch or other authorities on the subject, don't leave out the parts you don't like (e.g. Effective Java, item on Thread Safety: <em>Typically it is the lock on the instance itself, but there are exceptions.)</em></li>

<p>However, sometimes I want to ignore a test based on runtime information.  An example might be if I have a concurrency test that needs to be run on a machine with a certain number of cores.  If this test were run on a uniprocessor machine, I don't think it would be correct to just pass the test (since it hasn't been run), and it certainly wouldn't be right to fail the test and break the build.</p>

<p>So I want to be able to ignore tests at runtime, as this seems like the right outcome (since the test framework will allow the build to pass but record that the tests weren't run).  I'm fairly sure that the annotation won't give me this flexibility, and suspect that I'll need to manually create the test suite for the class in question.  However, the documentation doesn't mention anything about this and looking through the <a href=""http://junit.org/apidocs/junit/framework/TestSuite.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">API</a> it's also not clear how this would be done programmatically (i.e. how do I programatically create an instance of <code>Test</code> or similar that is equivalent to that created by the <code>@Ignore</code> annotation?).</p>

<p>For logging I (and indeed the people I work with) have always used JUL (java.util.logging) and never had any issues with it. However now I need to understand in more detail what I should do for my API development. I've done some research on this and with the information I've got I just get more confused. Hence this post.</p>

<p>Since I come from JUL I'm biased on that. My knowledge of the rest is not that big.</p>

<p>From the research I've done I've come up with these reasons why people do not like JUL:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>""I started developing in Java long before Sun released JUL and it was just easier for me to continue with logging-framework-X rather than to learn something new""</em>. Hmm. I'm not kidding, this is actually what people say. With this argument we could all be doing COBOL. (however I can certainly relate to this being a lazy dude myself)</p></li>
<li><p><em>""I don't like the names of the logging levels in JUL""</em>. Ok, seriously, this is just not enough of a reason to introduce a new dependency.</p></li>
<li><p><em>""I don't like the standard format of the output from JUL""</em>. Hmm. This is just configuration. You do not even have to do anything code-wise. (true, back in old days you may have had to create your own Formatter class to get it right).</p></li>
<li><p><em>""I use other libraries that also use logging-framework-X so I thought it easier just to use that one""</em>. This is a circular argument, isn't ? Why does 'everybody' use logging-framework-X and not JUL?</p></li>
<li><p><em>""Everybody else is using logging-framework-X""</em>. This to me is just a special case of the above. Majority is not always right.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So the real big question is <strong>why not JUL?</strong>. What is it I have missed ? The raison d'être for logging facades (SLF4J, JCL) is that multiple logging implementations have existed historically and the reason for that really goes back to the era before JUL as I see it. If JUL was perfect then logging facades wouldn't exist, or what? To make matters more confusing JUL is to some extent a facade itself, allowing Handlers, Formatters and even the LogManager to be swapped. </p>

<p>Rather than embracing multiple ways of doing the same thing (logging), shouldn't we question why they were necessary in the first place? (and see if those reasons still exist)</p>

<p>Ok, my research so far has led to a couple of things that I can see may be <strong>real issues</strong> with JUL:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Performance</strong>. Some say that performance in SLF4J is superior to the rest. This seems to me to be a case of premature optimization. If you need to log hundreds of megabytes per second then I'm not sure you are on the right path anyway. JUL has also evolved and the tests you did on Java 1.4 may no longer be true. You can read about it <a href=""http://jeremymanson.blogspot.dk/2009/04/faster-logging-with-faster-logger.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> and this fix has made it into Java 7. Many also talk about the overhead of string concatenation in logging methods. However template based logging avoids this cost and it exist also in JUL. Personally I never really write template based logging. Too lazy for that. For example if I do this with JUL:</p>

<pre><code>log.finest(""Lookup request from username="" + username 
   + "", valueX="" + valueX
   + "", valueY="" + valueY));
</code></pre>

<p>my IDE will warn me and ask permission that it should change it to:</p>

<pre><code>log.log(Level.FINEST, ""Lookup request from username={0}, valueX={1}, valueY={2}"", 
   new Object[]{username, valueX, valueY});
</code></pre>

<p>.. which I will of course accept. Permission granted ! Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>So I don't actually write such statements myself, that is done by the IDE.</p>

<p>In conclusion on the issue of performance I haven't found anything that would suggest that JUL's performance is not ok compared to the competition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Configuration from classpath</strong>. Out-of-the-box JUL cannot load a configuration file from the classpath. It is a <a href=""http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4958543"" rel=""noreferrer"">few lines of code</a> to make it do so. I can see why this may be annoying but the solution is short and simple.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Availability of output handlers</strong>. JUL comes with 5 output handlers out-of-the-box: console, file stream, socket and memory. These can be extended or new ones can be written. This may for example be writing to UNIX/Linux Syslog and Windows Event Log. I have personally never had this requirement nor have I seen it used but I can certainly relate to why it may be a useful feature. Logback comes with an appender for Syslog for example. Still I would argue that</p>

<ol>
<li>99.5% of the needs for output destinations are covered by what is in JUL out-of-the-box.</li>
<li>Special needs could be catered for by custom handlers on top of JUL rather than on top of something else. There's nothing to me that suggests that it takes more time to write a Syslog output handler for JUL than it does for another logging framework.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm really concerned that there's something I've overlooked. The use of logging facades  and logging implementations other than JUL is so widespread that I have to come to the conclusion that it's me who just doesn't understand. That wouldn't be the first time, I'm afraid. :-)</p>

<p>So what should I do with my API?  I want it to become successful.  I can of course just ""go with the flow"" and implement SLF4J (which seems the most popular these days) but for my own sake I still need to understand exactly what is wrong with the JUL of today that warrants all the fuzz?  Will I sabotage myself by choosing JUL for my library ?</p>

<h2>Testing performance</h2>

<p>(section added by nolan600 on 07-JUL-2012)</p>

<p>There's a reference below from Ceki about SLF4J's parametrization being 10 times or more faster than JUL's. So I've started doing some simple tests. At first glance the claim is certainly correct. Here are the preliminary results (but read on!):</p>

<ul>
<li>Execution time SLF4J, backend Logback: 1515</li>
<li>Execution time SLF4J, backend JUL: 12938</li>
<li>Execution time JUL: 16911</li>
</ul>

<p>The numbers above are msecs so less is better. So 10 times performance difference is by first actually pretty close. My initial reaction: That is a lot !</p>

<p>Here is the core of the test. As can be seen an integer and a string is construted in a loop which is then used in the log statement:</p>

<pre><code>    for (int i = 0; i &lt; noOfExecutions; i++) {
        for (char x=32; x&lt;88; x++) {
            String someString = Character.toString(x);
            // here we log 
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>(I wanted the log statement to have both a primitive data type (in this case an int) and a more complex data type (in this case a String). Not sure it matters but there you have it.)</p>

<p>The log statement for SLF4J:</p>

<pre><code>logger.info(""Logging {} and {} "", i, someString);
</code></pre>

<p>The log statement for JUL:</p>

<pre><code>logger.log(Level.INFO, ""Logging {0} and {1}"", new Object[]{i, someString});
</code></pre>

<p>The JVM was 'warmed up' with the same test executed once before the actual measurement was done. Java 1.7.03 was used on Windows 7. Latest versions of SLF4J (v1.6.6) and Logback (v1.0.6) was used. Stdout and stderr was redirected to null device.</p>

<p>However, careful now, it turns out JUL is spending most of its time in <code>getSourceClassName()</code> because JUL by default prints the source class name in the output, while Logback doesn't. So we are comparing apples and oranges. I have to do the test again and configure the logging implementations in a similar manner so that they actually output the same stuff. I do however suspect that SLF4J+Logback will still come out on top but far from the initial numbers as given above. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Btw: The test was first time I've actually worked with SLF4J or Logback. A pleasant experience. JUL is certainly a lot less welcoming when you are starting out.</p>

<h2>Testing performance (part 2)</h2>

<p>(section added by nolan600 on 08-JUL-2012)</p>

<p>As it turns out it doesn't really matter for performance how you configure your pattern in JUL, i.e. whether or not it includes the source name or not. I tried with a very simple pattern:</p>

<pre><code>java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format=""%4$s: %5$s [%1$tc]%n""
</code></pre>

<p>and that did not change the above timings at all. My profiler revealed that the logger still spent a lot of time in calls to <code>getSourceClassName()</code> even if this was not part of my pattern. The pattern doesn't matter.</p>

<p>I'm therefore concluding on the issue of performance that at least for the tested template based log statement there seems to be roughly a factor of 10 in real performance difference between JUL (slow) and SLF4J+Logback (quick). Just like Ceki said.</p>

<p>I can also see another thing namely that SLF4J's <code>getLogger()</code> call is a lot more expensive than JUL's ditto. (95 ms vs 0.3 ms if my profiler is accurate). This makes sense. SLF4J has to do some time on the binding of the underlying logging implementation. This doesn't scare me. These calls should be somewhat rare in the lifetime of an application. The fastness should be in the actual log calls.</p>

<h1>Final conclusion</h1>

<p>(section added by nolan600 on 08-JUL-2012)</p>

<p>Thank you for all your answers. Contrary to what I initially thought I've ended up deciding to use SLF4J for my API. This is based on a number of things and your input:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It gives flexibility to choose log implementation at deployment time.</p></li>
<li><p>Issues with lack of flexibility of JUL's configuration when run inside an application server.</p></li>
<li><p>SLF4J is certainly a lot faster as detailed above in particular if you couple it with Logback. Even if this was just a rough test I have reason to believe that a lot more effort has gone into optimization on SLF4J+Logback than on JUL.</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation. The documentation for SLF4J is simply a lot more comprehensive and precise.</p></li>
<li><p>Pattern flexibility. As I did the tests I set out to have JUL mimic the default pattern from Logback. This pattern includes the name of the thread. It turns out JUL cannot do this out of the box. Ok, I haven't missed it until now, but I don't think it is a thing that should be missing from a log framework. Period! </p></li>
<li><p>Most (or many) Java projects today use Maven so adding a dependency is not that big a thing especially if that dependency is rather stable, i.e. doesn't constantly change its API. This seems to be true for SLF4J. Also the SLF4J jar and friends are small in size.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So the strange thing that happened was that I actually got quite upset with JUL after having worked a bit with SLF4J. I still regret that it has to be this way with JUL. JUL is far from perfect but kind of does the job. Just not quite well enough. The same can be said about <code>Properties</code> as an example but we do not think about abstracting that so people can plug in their own configuration library and what have you. I think the reason is that <code>Properties</code> comes in just above the bar while the opposite is true for JUL of today ... and in the past it came in at zero because it didn't exist.</p>

"23453287","1","23476994","","2014-05-04 06:25:21","","345","35425","<p>One of the most useful features of Java 8 are the new <code>default</code> methods on interfaces. There are essentially two reasons (there may be others) why they have been introduced:</p>

<ul>
<li>Providing actual default implementations. Example: <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html#remove--""><code>Iterator.remove()</code></a></li>
<li>Allowing for JDK API evolution. Example: <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html#forEach-java.util.function.Consumer-""><code>Iterable.forEach()</code></a></li>
</ul>

<p>From an API designer's perspective, I would have liked to be able to use other modifiers on interface methods, e.g. <code>final</code>. This would be useful when adding convenience methods, preventing ""accidental"" overrides in implementing classes:</p>

<pre><code>interface Sender {

    // Convenience method to send an empty message
    default final void send() {
        send(null);
    }

    // Implementations should only implement this method
    void send(String message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above is already common practice if <code>Sender</code> were a class:</p>

<pre><code>abstract class Sender {

    // Convenience method to send an empty message
    final void send() {
        send(null);
    }

    // Implementations should only implement this method
    abstract void send(String message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, <code>default</code> and <code>final</code> are obviously contradicting keywords, but the default keyword itself <a href=""http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/lambda-dev/2012-August/005393.html"">would not have been strictly required</a>, so I'm assuming that this contradiction is deliberate, to reflect the subtle differences between <em>""class methods with body""</em> (just methods) and <em>""interface methods with body""</em> (default methods), i.e. differences which I have not yet understood.</p>

<p>At some point of time, support for modifiers like <code>static</code> and <code>final</code> on interface methods was not yet fully explored, <a href=""http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/lambda-dev/2011-December/004430.html"">citing Brian Goetz</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The other part is how far we're going to go to support class-building 
  tools in interfaces, such as final methods, private methods, protected 
  methods, static methods, etc.  The answer is: we don't know yet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since that time in late 2011, obviously, support for <code>static</code> methods in interfaces was added. Clearly, this added a lot of value to the JDK libraries themselves, such as with <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#comparing-java.util.function.Function-""><code>Comparator.comparing()</code></a>.</p>

<h3>Question:</h3>

<p>What is the reason <code>final</code> (and also <code>static final</code>) never made it to Java 8 interfaces?</p>

<p>I'm also having the same issue with other date fields so I was hoping there would be a generic way to 'ignore' the fields of lesser significance. </p>

<p>In other words, the months between Feb and 4 March would also be 1, as would the hours between 14:45 and 15:12 be. However the hour difference between 14:01 and 14:55 would be 0.</p>

In addition, no one seemed to dare to upvote, nor downvote my answer.</p>

<p>I was told there that it's bad practice, but then I was also told that garbage collector runs don't systematically stop the world anymore, and that it could also effectively be used by the JVM only as a hint, so I'm kind of at loss.</p>

<p>I do understand that the JVM usually knows better than you when it needs to reclaim memory. I also understand that worrying about a few kilobytes of data is silly. I also understand that even megabytes of data isn't what it was a few years back. But still, 1.5 gigabytes? And you <em>know</em> there's like 1.5 GB of data hanging around in memory; it's not like it's a shot in the dark. Is <code>System.gc()</code> systematically bad, or is there some point at which it becomes okay?</p>

<p>So the question is actually double:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is or isn't it bad practice to call <code>System.gc()</code>? Is it really merely a hint to the JVM under certain implementations, or is it always a full collection cycle? Are there really garbage collector implementations that can do their work without stopping the world? Please shed some light over the various assertions people have made in the comments to my <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/2406360/3650944"">answer</a>.</li>
<li>Where's the threshold? Is it <em>never</em> a good idea to call <code>System.gc()</code>, or are there times when it's acceptable? If so, what are those times?</li>

<p>Still, I don't fully understand the concept, and especially when it is safe or dangerous to user <strong>inner classes inside an Activity</strong>.</p>

<p>This is what I understood:</p>

<p>A memory leak will occur if an instance of an inner class survives longer than its outer class (an Activity).
-> <strong>In which situations can this happen?</strong> </p>

<p>In this example, I suppose there is no risk of leak, because there is no way the anonymous class extending <code>OnClickListener</code> will live longer than the activity, right?</p>

<pre><code>    final Dialog dialog = new Dialog(this);
    dialog.setContentView(R.layout.dialog_generic);
    Button okButton = (Button) dialog.findViewById(R.id.dialog_button_ok);
    TextView titleTv = (TextView) dialog.findViewById(R.id.dialog_generic_title);

    // *** Handle button click
    okButton.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
        public void onClick(View v) {
            dialog.dismiss();
        }
    });

    titleTv.setText(""dialog title"");
    dialog.show();
</code></pre>

<p>Now, is this example dangerous, and why?</p>

<pre><code>// We are still inside an Activity
_handlerToDelayDroidMove = new Handler();
_handlerToDelayDroidMove.postDelayed(_droidPlayRunnable, 10000);

private Runnable _droidPlayRunnable = new Runnable() { 
    public void run() {
        _someFieldOfTheActivity.performLongCalculation();
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>I have a doubt regarding the fact that understanding this topic has to do with understanding in detail what is kept when an activity is destroyed and re-created.</p>

<p>Is it?</p>

<p>Let say I just changed the orientation of the device (which is the most common cause of leaks). When <code>super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)</code> will be called in my <code>onCreate()</code>, will this restore the values of the fields (as they were before orientation change)? Will this also restore the states of inner classes?</p>

<p>I realize my question is not very precise, but I'd really appreciate any explanation that could make things clearer.</p>

<p>To demonstrate what I mean, if I wanted to have a User interface and a User implementation I'd have two choices in Java:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Class = User, Interface = UserInterface</li>
  <li>Class = UserImpl, Interface = User</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Where in most languages:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Class = User, Interface = IUser</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, you might argue that you could always pick a most descriptive name for the user implementation and the problem goes away, but Java's pushing a POJO approach to things and   most IOC containers use DynamicProxies extensively.  These two things together mean that you'll have lots of interfaces with a single POJO implementation.</p>

<p>So, I guess my question boils down to: <strong>""Is it worth following the broader Interface naming convention especially in light of where Java Frameworks seem to be heading?""</strong></p>

<p>Then I manually installed the JDK (1.7) on my Mac. It seems that the installation worked fine. When the installation was done, I opened the terminal and typed <code>java -version</code> as well. It also showed the same error:</p>

<blockquote>

Most (if not all) of them depend on Hibernate, but I'd like to discuss them JPA-implementation-neutrally (I am using EclipseLink, by the way).</p>

<p>All possible implementations are having their own <strong>advantages</strong> and <strong>disadvantages</strong> regarding:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code></strong> contract <strong>conformity</strong> (immutability) for <code>List</code>/<code>Set</code> operations</li>
<li>Whether <strong>identical</strong> objects (e.g. from different sessions, dynamic proxies from lazily-loaded data structures) can be detected</li>
<li>Whether entities behave correctly in <strong>detached (or non-persisted) state</strong> 
<br></li>
</ul>

<p>As far I can see, there are <strong>three options</strong>: </p>

<ol>
<li>Do not override them; rely on <code>Object.equals()</code> and <code>Object.hashCode()</code>

<ul>
<li><code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code> work</li>
<li>cannot identify identical objects, problems with dynamic proxies</li>
<li>no problems with detached entities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Override them, based on the <strong>primary key</strong>

<ul>
<li><code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code> are broken</li>
<li>correct identity (for all managed entities)</li>
<li>problems with detached entities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Override them, based on the <strong>Business-Id</strong> (non-primary key fields; what about foreign keys?)

<ul>
<li><code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code> are broken</li>
<li>correct identity (for all managed entities)</li>
<li>no problems with detached entities</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My questions are:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Did I miss an option and/or pro/con point?<br></li>
<li>What option did you choose and why?</li>
</ol>

<p><br><br>
<strong>UPDATE 1:</strong></p>

<p>By ""<code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code> are broken"", I mean that successive <code>hashCode()</code> invocations may return differing values, which is (when correctly implemented) not broken in the sense of the <code>Object</code> API documentation, but which causes problems when trying to retrieve a changed entity from a <code>Map</code>,  <code>Set</code> or other hash-based <code>Collection</code>.  Consequently, JPA implementations (at least EclipseLink) will not work correctly in some cases.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for your answers -- most of them have remarkable quality.<br>
Unfortunately, I am still unsure which approach will be the best for a real-life application, or how to determine the best approach for my application.  So, I'll keep the question open and hope for some more discussions and/or opinions.</p>

I was wondering if there is any performance impact? Is is just as fast as <code>==</code>?</p>

<p>For example, I have a base class with 10 subclasses. In a single function that takes the base class, I do checks for if the class is an instance of the subclass and carry out some routine. </p>

<p>One of the other ways I thought of solving it was to use a ""type id"" integer primitive instead, and use a bitmask to represent categories of the subclasses, and then just do a bit mask comparison of the subclasses ""type id"" to a constant mask representing the category.</p>

<p>Is <code>instanceof</code> somehow optimized by the JVM to be faster than that? I want to stick to Java but the performance of the app is critical. It would be cool if someone that has been down this road before could offer some advice. Am I nitpicking too much or focusing on the wrong thing to optimize?</p>

<p>According to Sun, the error happens ""if too much time is being spent in garbage collection: if more than 98% of the total time is spent in garbage collection and less than 2% of the heap is recovered, an OutOfMemoryError will be thrown."".</p>

A <em>(quite pointless)</em> example in Java:</p>

<p><strong>a)</strong> declaration before loop:</p>

<pre><code>double intermediateResult;
for(int i=0; i &lt; 1000; i++){
    intermediateResult = i;

<p>Which one is better, <strong>a</strong> or <strong>b</strong>? </p>

<p>I suspect that repeated variable declaration (example <strong>b</strong>) creates more overhead <em>in theory</em>, but that compilers are smart enough so that it doesn't matter.

<p>However, since I migrated to Java 8 (1.8.0-ea-b90) Maven is absolutely strict about missing documentation tags and show me lots of Javadoc errors related to Javadoc problems when I try to build or install a project where the Javadoc is not ""perfect"". Some of the projects I am trying to compile and install in my local repository are third party projects from which I do not have control. So the workaround of just fixing all the Javadocs in all these projects does not seem to be feasable in my scenario.</p>

<p>The Javadoc Maven plugin is configured like this in my POM:</p>

    &lt;/executions&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As I said before, everything is working fine if I go back to Java 7. 
Maybe is this a bug related to Maven running in Java 8?
How could I make it work (i.e., being able to build the Javadoc of the project and install its code in my local repository) with Java 8?
I have tested with both Maven 3.0.3 and 3.0.5 in OSX.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>If I change my Javadoc plugin configuration with <code>&lt;failOnError&gt;false&lt;/failOnError&gt;</code> (thanks Martin):</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-javadoc-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;

    &lt;executions&gt;
        &lt;execution&gt;
            &lt;id&gt;attach-javadocs&lt;/id&gt;

        &lt;/execution&gt;
    &lt;/executions&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;

<p>Then the project is installed in my local repository. However, the Javadoc JAR is still not generated.</p>

<p>A fragment of the output I see in the console with this new configuration is:</p>

It's really all static, no serverside logic to program. I should mention I'm completely new to Java. JSP files seem to make it easy to work with common includes and variables, much like <code>PHP</code>, but I'd like to know a simple way to get something like template inheritance (<code>Django</code> style) or at least be able to have a base.jsp file containing the header and the footer, so I can insert content later.</p>

<p><em>Ben Lings</em> seems to offer some hope in his answer here:
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/490390/jsp-template-inheritance"">JSP template inheritance</a>
Can someone explain how to achieve this?</p>

<p>Given that I don't have much time I think dynamic routing is a little much, so I'm happy to just to have URLs map directly onto <code>.jsp</code> files, but I'm open to suggestion.</p>

<p><em>Thanks.</em></p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> I don't want to use any external libraries, because it would increase the learning curve for myself and others who work on the project, and the company I work for has been contracted to do this.</p>

<p><strong>Another edit:</strong> I'm not sure if <code>JSP tags</code> will be useful because my content doesn't really have any template variables. What I need is a way to be able to do this:</p>

<p><code>base.html:</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
{ content.body }
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>I started setting up my Ubuntu 12.10 on April 2013 and the normal  <code>sudo apt-get install maven</code> was not working for maven 3 back then. </p>

<p>The <strong>manual installation</strong> in this post is useful if you like to dig in deeper to your ubuntu kernel in regards with apt-get and where it finds the list of applications that are available for installation on Ubuntu
. It can also be potentially useful for more recent releases of Ubuntu like <strong>Ubuntu 15.04</strong>, etc. if you face the same problem as I did back then with Ubuntu 12.10. </p>

<h2>Automatic Installation via apt-get:</h2>

<p>Checkout the <strong>manual installation</strong> if your current ubuntu can not install maven via common 'apt-get install maven'.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install maven
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure to remove maven 2 if your ubuntu is not fresh or if you were using maven 2 before:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get remove maven2
</code></pre>

<h2>Manual Installation via apt-get by adding maven 3 repository (Ubuntu 14.04 check out update 1):</h2>

<p>This can be useful if your ubuntu apt-get repositories list is not up to date.</p>

<p>Maven 3 was required to set up the system and as it turns out most of the documents out there are referring to how to install Maven to Ubuntu version 12.04 or before. Best document I found was:</p>

<p><a href=""http://killertilapia.blogspot.com.au/2012/10/installing-maven-3-in-ubuntu-1204.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">killertilapia's blog</a></p>

<p>The whole process I came up with is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>sudo -H gedit /etc/apt/sources.list</code></li>
<li><p>Add the following line the <code>sources.list</code> file:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>deb <a href=""http://ppa.launchpad.net/natecarlson/maven3/ubuntu"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://ppa.launchpad.net/natecarlson/maven3/ubuntu</a> precise main </p>
  
  <p>deb-src <a href=""http://ppa.launchpad.net/natecarlson/maven3/ubuntu"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://ppa.launchpad.net/natecarlson/maven3/ubuntu</a> precise main</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install maven3</code></p></li>
<li><code>sudo ln -s /usr/share/maven3/bin/mvn /usr/bin/mvn</code></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caution 1: command ""sudo apt-add-repository ppa:natecarlson/maven3"" did not work on my  Ubuntu and had to run <code>sudo apt-add-repository -rm ppa:natecarlson/maven3</code> to get my apt-get to work again.</p>
  
  <p>Caution 2: thanks to David, you need to remove your existing symbolic link to previous versions of maven before running step 4.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>OS X Installation</h2>

<p>I decided to add OS X installation in case you use multiple environments for your dev: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8826881/maven-install-on-mac-os-x"">See the source stackoverflow thread for more details</a>.</p>

<p>Install <a href=""http://brew.sh/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Homebrew</a> that is the equavalent of <code>apt-get</code>, then install Maven using:</p>

<pre><code>brew install maven
</code></pre>

<h2><strong>Update 1</strong>: <strong>Installation for Ubunutu 14.04</strong></h2>

<p>Haven't tried this myself but I am confident this should work without security warnings:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get purge maven maven2 maven3
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:andrei-pozolotin/maven3
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install maven3
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>I occasionally find myself needing to make a private method in a class public just to write some unit tests for it.</p>

<p>Usually this would be because the method contains logic shared between other methods in the class and it's tidier to test the logic on its own, or another reason could be possible be I want to test logic used in synchronous threads without having to worry about threading problems.</p>

<p>Do other people find themselves doing this, because I don't really like doing it?? I personally think the bonuses outweigh the problems of making a method public which doesn't really provide any service outside of the class...</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for answers everyone, seems to have piqued peoples' interest. I think the general consensus is testing should happen via the public API as this is the only way a class will ever be used, and I do agree with this. The couple of cases I mentioned above where I would do this above were uncommon cases and I thought the benefits of doing it was worth it.</p>

<p>I can however, see everyones point that it should never really happen.

<li>a variable defined in gradle.properties</li>

<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5579744/what-is-the-difference-between-pathparam-and-queryparam"">What is the difference between @PathParam and @QueryParam</a></p>

<p>This is a ""best practices"" or convention question.</p>

<p>When would you use <code>@PathParam</code> vs <code>@QueryParam</code>.</p>

<p>What I can think of that the decision might be using the two to differentiate the information pattern. Let me illustrate below my LTPO - less than perfect observation.</p>

<p>PathParam use could be reserved for information category, which would fall nicely into a branch of an information tree. PathParam could be used to drill down to entity class hierarchy.</p>

<p>Whereas, QueryParam could be reserved for specifying attributes to locate the instance of a class.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/Vehicle/Car?registration=123</code></li>
<li><code>/House/Colonial?region=newengland</code></li>
</ul>

<p><code>/category?instance</code></p>

<pre><code>@GET
@Path(""/employee/{dept}"")
Patient getEmployee(@PathParam(""dept"")Long dept, @QueryParam(""id"")Long id) ;
</code></pre>

<p>vs <code>/category/instance</code></p>

<pre><code>@GET
@Path(""/employee/{dept}/{id}"")
Patient getEmployee(@PathParam(""dept"")Long dept, @PathParam(""id"")Long id) ;
</code></pre>

<p>vs <code>?category+instance</code></p>

<pre><code>@GET
@Path(""/employee"")
Patient getEmployee(@QueryParam(""dept"")Long dept, @QueryParam(""id"")Long id) ;
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think there is a standard convention of doing it. Is there? However, I would like to hear of how people use PathParam vs QueryParam to differentiate their information like I exemplified above. I would also love to hear the reason behind the practice.</p>

<p>The simplest method of having a parent pom would be putting it in the root of a project i.e.</p>

<pre><code>myproject/
  myproject-core/
  myproject-api/
  myproject-app/
  pom.xml
</code></pre>

<p>where the pom.xml is both the parent project as well as describes the -core -api and -app modules</p>

<p>The next method is to separate out the parent into its own subdirectory as in</p>

<pre><code>myproject/
  mypoject-parent/
    pom.xml
  myproject-core/
  myproject-api/
  myproject-app/
</code></pre>

<p>Where the parent pom still contains the modules but they're relative, e.g. ../myproject-core</p>

<p>Finally, there's the option where the module definition and the parent are separated as in</p>

<pre><code>myproject/
  mypoject-parent/
    pom.xml
  myproject-core/
  myproject-api/
  myproject-app/
  pom.xml
</code></pre>

<p>Where the parent pom contains any ""shared"" configuration (dependencyManagement, properties etc.) and the myproject/pom.xml contains the list of modules.</p>

<p>The intention is to be scalable to a large scale build so should be scalable to a large number of projects and artifacts.</p>

<p>A few bonus questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where is the best place to define the various shared configuration as in source control, deployment directories, common plugins etc. (I'm assuming the parent but I've often been bitten by this and they've ended up in each project rather than a common one).</li>
<li>How do the maven-release plugin, hudson and nexus deal with how you set up your multi-projects (possibly a giant question, it's more if anyone has been caught out when by how a multi-project build has been set up)?</li>

<pre><code>if (opt.isPresent()) {
  System.out.println(""found"");
} else {
  System.out.println(""Not found"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is not a 'functional style', though.</p>

<p><code>Optional</code> has an <code>ifPresent()</code> method, but I am unable to chain an <code>orElse()</code> method.</p>

<p>Thus, I cannot write:</p>

<pre><code>opt.ifPresent( x -&gt; System.out.println(""found "" + x))
   .orElse( System.out.println(""NOT FOUND""));
</code></pre>

<p>In reply to @assylias, I don't think <code>Optional.map()</code> works for the following case:</p>

<pre><code>opt.map( o -&gt; {
  System.out.println(""while opt is present..."");
  o.setProperty(xxx);
  dao.update(o);
  return null;
}).orElseGet( () -&gt; {
  System.out.println(""create new obj"");
  dao.save(new obj);
  return null;
});
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, when <code>opt</code> is present, I update its property and save to the database. When it is not available, I create a new <code>obj</code> and save to the database.</p>

<p>Note in the two lambdas I have to return <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>But when <code>opt</code> is present, both lambdas will be executed. <code>obj</code> will be updated, and a new object will be saved to the database . This is because of the <code>return null</code> in the first lambda. And <code>orElseGet()</code> will continue to execute.</p>

<p><strong>Amendment</strong></p>

<p>I accept the answer below, but here's an alternate take by Martin Fowler who <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html#ServiceLocatorVsDependencyInjection"" rel=""noreferrer"">discusses the merits of Dependency Injection vs. using a Service Locator</a> (which is essentially the same as calling a wrapped <code>ApplicationContext.getBean()</code>).</p>

<p>In part, Fowler states, ""<em>With service locator the application class asks for it [the service] explicitly by a message to the locator. With injection there is no explicit request, the service appears in the application class - hence the inversion of control.
Inversion of control is a common feature of frameworks, but it's something that comes at a price. It tends to be hard to understand and leads to problems when you are trying to debug. So on the whole I prefer to avoid it [Inversion of Control] unless I need it. This isn't to say it's a bad thing, just that I think it needs to justify itself over the more straightforward alternative.</em>""</p>

Part of this code involves multiplying <code>double</code> variables by <code>10</code> raised to arbitrary non-negative <code>int</code> <code>exponent</code>s. One fast way (edit: but not the fastest possible, see Update 2 below) to get the multiplied value is to <code>switch</code> on the <code>exponent</code>:</p>

<pre><code>double multiplyByPowerOfTen(final double d, final int exponent) {
   switch (exponent) {
      case 0:
         return d;
      case 1:
         return d*10;
      case 2:
         return d*100;
      // ... same pattern
      case 9:
         return d*1000000000;
      case 10:
         return d*10000000000L;
      // ... same pattern with long literals
      case 18:
         return d*1000000000000000000L;
      default:
         throw new ParseException(""Unhandled power of ten "" + power, 0);
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The commented ellipses above indicate that the <code>case</code> <code>int</code> constants continue incrementing by 1, so there are really 19 <code>case</code>s in the above code snippet. Since I wasn't sure whether I would actually need all the powers of 10 in <code>case</code> statements <code>10</code> thru <code>18</code>, I ran some microbenchmarks comparing the time to complete 10 million operations with this <code>switch</code> statement versus a <code>switch</code> with only <code>case</code>s <code>0</code> thru <code>9</code> (with the <code>exponent</code> limited to 9 or less to avoid breaking the pared-down <code>switch</code>). I got the rather surprising (to me, at least!) result that the longer <code>switch</code> with more <code>case</code> statements actually ran faster.</p>

<p>On a lark, I tried adding even more <code>case</code>s which just returned dummy values, and found that  I could get the switch to run even faster with around 22-27 declared <code>case</code>s (even though those dummy cases are never actually hit while the code is running). (Again, <code>case</code>s were added in a contiguous fashion by incrementing the prior <code>case</code> constant by <code>1</code>.) These execution time differences are not very significant: for a random <code>exponent</code> between <code>0</code> and <code>10</code>, the dummy padded <code>switch</code> statement finishes 10 million executions in 1.49 secs versus 1.54 secs for the unpadded version, for a grand total savings of 5ns per execution. So, not the kind of thing that makes obsessing over padding out a <code>switch</code> statement worth the effort from an optimization standpoint. But I still just find it curious and counter-intuitive that a <code>switch</code> doesn't become slower (or perhaps at best maintain constant <em>O(1)</em> time) to execute as more <code>case</code>s are added to it.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kbnan.png"" alt=""switch benchmarking results""></p>

<p>These are the results I obtained from running with various limits on the randomly-generated <code>exponent</code> values. I didn't include the results all the way down to <code>1</code> for the <code>exponent</code> limit, but the general shape of the curve remains the same, with a ridge around the 12-17 case mark, and a valley between 18-28. All tests were run in JUnitBenchmarks using shared containers for the random values to ensure identical testing inputs. I also ran the tests both in order from longest <code>switch</code> statement to shortest, and vice-versa, to try and eliminate the possibility of ordering-related test problems.  I've put my testing code up on a github repo if anyone wants to try to reproduce these results.</p>

<p>So, what's going on here? Some vagaries of my architecture or micro-benchmark construction? Or is the Java <code>switch</code> really a little faster to execute in the <code>18</code> to <code>28</code> <code>case</code> range than it is from <code>11</code> up to <code>17</code>?</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/abissell/switch-experiment"" rel=""noreferrer"">github test repo ""switch-experiment""</a></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I cleaned up the benchmarking library quite a bit and added a text file in /results with some output across a wider range of possible <code>exponent</code> values. I also added an option in the testing code not to throw an <code>Exception</code> from <code>default</code>, but this doesn't appear to affect the results.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> Found some pretty good discussion of this issue from back in 2009 on the xkcd forum here: <a href=""http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=33524"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=33524</a>. The OP's discussion of using <code>Array.binarySearch()</code> gave me the idea for a simple array-based implementation of the exponentiation pattern above. There's no need for the binary search since I know what the entries in the <code>array</code> are. It appears to run about 3 times faster than using <code>switch</code>, obviously at the expense of some of the control flow that <code>switch</code> affords. That code has been added to the github repo also.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The output that I am getting is <code>29 years 8 months 24 days 12 hours 0 minutes 50 seconds</code>. I have checked my result from this <a href=""http://www.epochconverter.com/epoch/date-difference.php"">website</a> (with values <code>12/16/1984 07:45:55</code> and <code>09/09/2014 19:46:45</code>). The following screenshot shows the output:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SAJE4.png"" alt=""Epoch Converter""></p>

<p>I am pretty sure that the fields after the month value is coming wrong from my code. Any suggestion would be very helpful.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I have tested my result from another website and the result I got is different. Here it is: <a href=""http://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?d1=16&amp;m1=12&amp;y1=1984&amp;d2=9&amp;m2=9&amp;y2=2014&amp;h1=7&amp;i1=45&amp;s1=55&amp;h2=19&amp;i2=46&amp;s2=45"">Calculate duration between two dates</a> (result: 29 years, 8 months, 24 days, 12 hours, 0 minutes and 50 seconds).</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Since I got two different results from two different sites, I am wondering if the algorithm of my calculation is legitimate or not. If I use following two <code>LocalDateTime</code> objects:</p>

<pre><code>LocalDateTime toDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2014, 9, 10, 6, 40, 45);
LocalDateTime fromDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(1984, 12, 16, 7, 45, 55);
</code></pre>

<p>Then the output is coming: <code>29 years 8 months 25 days -1 hours -5 minutes -10 seconds.</code></p>

<p>From this <a href=""http://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?d1=16&amp;m1=12&amp;y1=1984&amp;d2=10&amp;m2=9&amp;y2=2014&amp;h1=7&amp;i1=45&amp;s1=55&amp;h2=6&amp;i2=40&amp;s2=45"">link</a> it should be <code>29 years 8 months 24 days 22 hours, 54 minutes and 50 seconds</code>. So the algorithm needs to handle the negative numbers too.</p>

<p><strong>Note the question is not about which site gave me what result, I need to know the right algorithm and need to have right results.</strong></p>

<p>The code snippets below are generally flawed or broken, btw.  Breaking them is an interesting exercise for the reader.  <em>And to the hackers attacking the websites that use them</em>.</p>

<pre><code>LinearLayout buttonsView = new LinearLayout(this);
buttonsView.setOrientation(LinearLayout.VERTICAL);
for (int r = 0; r &lt; 6; ++r) {
    Button btn = new Button(this);
    btn.setText(""A"");

    lp.weight = 1.0f; // This is critical. Doesn't work without it.

ViewGroup.LayoutParams lp = new ViewGroup.LayoutParams(ViewGroup.LayoutParams.FILL_PARENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.FILL_PARENT);
setContentView(buttonsView, lp);

<p>So that works fine, but how on earth do you give the buttons margins so there is space between them? I tried using <code>LinearLayout.MarginLayoutParams</code>, but that has no <code>weight</code> member so it's no good. And it doesn't work if you pass it <code>lp</code> in its constructor either.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: Using <code>ulimit -v</code> allows limiting the amount of virtual memory.  If the size set is below 204 MB, then the application won't run even though it doesn't need 204 MB, only 64 MB.  So I want to understand why Java requires so much virtual memory.

We have a Spring MVC-based RESTful API which contains sensitive information. The API should be secured, however sending the user's credentials (user/pass combo) with each request is not desirable. Per REST guidelines (and internal business requirements), the server must remain stateless. The API will be consumed by another server in a mashup-style approach.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Client makes a request to <code>.../authenticate</code> (unprotected URL) with credentials; server returns a secure token which contains enough information for the server to validate future requests and remain stateless. This would likely consist of the same information as Spring Security's <a href=""http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/docs/3.1.x/reference/remember-me.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Remember-Me Token</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Client makes subsequent requests to various (protected) URLs, appending the previously obtained token as a query parameter (or, less desirably, an HTTP request header).</p></li>
<li><p>Client cannot be expected to store cookies.</p></li>
<li><p>Since we use Spring already, the solution should make use of Spring Security.</p></li>

Well, that's my first assumption, so if that's not correct, I probably haven't started very well...</p>

<p><strong>I was interested though in understanding how / when you distinguish the stores when using keytool.</strong></p>

<p>So, far I've created a keystore using</p>

<pre><code>keytool -import -alias bob -file bob.crt -keystore keystore.ks
</code></pre>

<p>which creates my keystore.ks file. I answer <code>yes</code> to the question do I trust bob but it is unclear to me if this has created a keystore file or a truststore file? I can set up my application to use the file as either.</p>

<pre><code>-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=keystore.ks -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=x
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=keystore.ks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=x
</code></pre>

<p>and with <code>System.setProperty( ""javax.net.debug"", ""ssl"")</code> set, I can see the certificate under trusted certifications (but not under the keystore section). The particular certificate I'm importing has only a public key and I intend to use it to send stuff over an SSL connection to Bob (but perhaps that's best left for another question!).</p>

<p>Any pointers or clarifications would be much appreciated. Is the output of keytool the same whatever you import and its just convention that says one is a keystore and the other a trust store? What's the relationship when using SSL etc?</p>

<p>So I built this abstract class:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Vehicle{....}
</code></pre>

<p>and 2 subclasses:</p>

<pre><code>public class Car extends Vehicle{....}
public class Boat extends Vehicle{....}
</code></pre>

<p><code>Car</code> and <code>Boat</code> also hold some unique fields and methods that aren't common (don't have the same name, so I can't define an abstract method for them in Vehicle).</p>

<p>Now in mainClass I have setup my new Garage:</p>

<pre><code>Vehicle[] myGarage= new Vehicle[10];
myGarage[0]=new Car(2,true);
myGarage[1]=new Boat(4,600);
</code></pre>

<p>I was very happy with polymorphism until I tried to access one of the fields that are unique to Car, such as:</p>

<pre><code>boolean carIsAutomatic = myGarage[0].auto;
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler doesn't accept that. I worked around this issue using casting:</p>

<pre><code>boolean carIsAutomatic = ((Car)myGarage[0]).auto;
</code></pre>

<p>That works... but it doesn't help with methods, just fields. Meaning I can't do</p>

<pre><code>(Car)myGarage[0].doSomeCarStuff();
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is - what do I really have in my garage? I'm trying to get the intuition as well as understand what's going on ""behind the scenes"".</p>

<hr>

<p>for the sake of future readers, a short summary of the answers below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Yes, there's a <code>Car</code> in <code>myGarage[]</code></li>
<li>Being a static typed language, the Java compiler will not lend access to methods/fields that are non-""Vehicle"", if accessing those through a data structure based on the Vehicle super class( such as <code>Vehicle myGarage[]</code>)</li>
<li>As for how to solve, there are 2 main approaches below:
<ol>
<li>Use type casting, which will ease the compiler's concerns and leave any errors in the design to run time</li>
<li>The fact that I need casting says the design is flawed. If I need access to non-Vehicle capabilities then I shouldn't be storing the Cars and Boats in a Vehicle based data structure. Either make all those capabilities belong to Vehicle, or use more specific (derived) type based structures</li>
</ol></li>
<li>In many cases, composition and/or interfaces would be a better alternative to inheritance. Probably the subject of my next question...</li>
<li>Plus many other good insights down there, if one does have the time to browse through the answers. </li>

<p>My question is, is the cost incurred in the throw/catch itself, or when creating the Exception object (since it gets a lot of runtime information including the execution stack)?</p>

<p>In other words, if I do</p>

<p>but don't throw it, is that most of the cost of throwing, or is the throw + catch handling what's costly?</p>

<p>I'm not asking whether putting code in a try/catch block adds to the cost of executing that code, I'm asking whether catching the Exception is the expensive part, or creating (calling the constructor for) the Exception is the expensive part.</p>

<p>Another way of asking this is, if I made one instance of Exception and threw and caught it over and over, would that be significantly faster than creating a new Exception every time I throw?</p>

EDIT: Adding a bounty as I needed a clearer answer. The ExecutorService code given below does not address my problem. Why should I sleep() after executing (some code - I have no handle over this piece of code)? If the code is completed and the sleep() is interrupted, how can that be a timeOut?</p>

<p>The task that needs to be executed is not in my control. It can be any piece of code. The problem is this piece of code might run into an infinite loop. I don't want that to happen. So, I just want to run that task in a separate thread. The parent thread has to wait till that thread finishes and needs to know the status of the task (i.e whether it timed out or some exception occured or if its a success). If the task goes into an infinite loop, my parent thread keeps on waiting indefinitely, which is not an ideal situation.</p>

<pre><code>public Employee setName(String name){

<p>This pattern can be useful because then you can chain setters like this:</p>

<pre><code>list.add(new Employee().setName(""Jack Sparrow"").setId(1).setFoo(""bacon!""));
</code></pre>

<p>instead of this:</p>

<pre><code>Employee e = new Employee();

<p>...but it sort of goes against standard convention. I suppose it might be worthwhile just because it can make that setter do something else useful. I've seen this pattern used some places (e.g. JMock, JPA), but it seems uncommon, and only generally used for very well defined APIs where this pattern is used everywhere.</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>What I've described is obviously valid, but what I am really looking for is some thoughts on whether this is generally acceptable, and if there are any pitfalls or related best practices.

<p>I could imagine that comparing against zero is faster, but performing a complete subtraction just to check whether it's negative seems a bit overkill to me.

<p>According to this article <a href=""http://www.javamex.com/tutorials/synchronization_volatile.shtml"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.javamex.com/tutorials/synchronization_volatile.shtml</a> there is a lot to be said and there are many differences but also some similarities.</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in this piece of info:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>access to a volatile variable never has the potential to block: we're only ever doing a simple read or write, so unlike a synchronized block we will never hold on to any lock;</li>
  <li>because accessing a volatile variable never holds a lock, it is not suitable for cases where we want to <strong>read-update-write</strong> as an atomic operation (unless we're prepared to ""miss an update"");</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>What do they mean by <strong>read-update-write</strong>? Isn't a write also an update or do they simply mean that the <strong>update</strong> is a write that depends on the read?</p>

<p>Most of all, when is it more suitable to declare variables <code>volatile</code> rather than access them through a <code>synchronized</code> block? Is it a good idea to use <code>volatile</code> for variables that depend on input? For instance, there is a variable called <code>render</code> that is read through the rendering loop and set by a keypress event?</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>In my first screen, I want username EditText to have focus on startup and Keyboard should be visible</strong>..This is my implementation (simplified by removing unnecessary/unrelated codes)..</p>

<p>Well, <strong>the keyboard is not showing at startup</strong>. And my design badly requires a keyboard there.</p>

<p>Now on to <strong>second page</strong>..I already said I have a listView and EditText there..<strong>I want my keyboard to be hidden on startup only to appear when the user touches the editText</strong>..Can you believe it?  whatever I tried <strong>soft Keyboard is showing when I load the activity</strong>..I am not able to hide it.</p>

<p>To simplify </p>

<ol>
<li>On Login Page (first Page)  I want my keyboard to be visible on
start up.</li>
<li>On SecondPage I want the keyboard to be hidden first, only to appear
when the user touches editText</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>And my problem is I am getting exact opposite on both occasion</strong>...Hope someone faced this issue before.BTW I am testing on simulator and HTC Desire phone.</p>

<h1>FINAL OUTCOME</h1>

<p>Well, I got it working, with the help of all friends here.</p>

<p><strong>1. To Show keyboard on startup</strong></p>

<p>Two answers worked for me. <strong>One provided by @CapDroid, which is to use a handler and post it delayed..</strong></p>

<pre><code>mUserNameEdit.postDelayed(new Runnable() {
  @Override
  public void run() {
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    InputMethodManager keyboard = (InputMethodManager)getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
    keyboard.showSoftInput(mUserNameEdit, 0);
  }
},50);
</code></pre>

<p>Second answers are provided by @Dyarish, In fact, he linked to another SO thread, which I haven't seen before. But the funny thing is that this solution is given in the thread which I referenced at the start. And I haven't tried
it out because it had zero votes in a thread where all other posts have plenty of votes..Height of foolishness..</p>

<pre><code>getWindow().setSoftInputMode(WindowManager.LayoutParams.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_VISIBLE);
</code></pre>

<p>For me, the second solution looked neat, so I decided to stick with it..But the first one certainly works.
Also, @Dyarish's answer contains a clever hack of using a ScrollView below EditText to give EditText the focus..But I haven't tried it, but it should work. Not neat though..</p>

<p><strong>2. To hide keyboard at activity start</strong></p>

<p>Only one answer worked for me, which is provided by @Dyarish. And the solution is to use 
focusableInTouchMode settings in xml for the layout containing the editText's. This did the trick</p>

<pre><code>&lt;LinearLayout android:layout_width=""fill_parent"" 
    android:layout_height=""fill_parent"" 
    android:orientation=""vertical"" 
    android:focusableInTouchMode=""true""&gt;
    &lt;EditText android:id=""@+id/filter_edittext""       
        android:layout_width=""fill_parent"" 
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content"" 
        android:hint=""Search"" android:inputType=""text"" 
        android:maxLines=""1""/&gt;
    &lt;ListView android:id=""@id/android:list"" 
        android:layout_height=""fill_parent""
        android:layout_weight=""1.0"" 
        android:layout_width=""fill_parent"" 
        android:focusable=""true"" 
        android:descendantFocusability=""beforeDescendants""/&gt;
&lt;/LinearLayout&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway, I end up using Dyarish's answer in both cases. So I am awarding the bounty to him..Thanks to all other friends
who tried to help me.. </p>

<pre><code>@Entity

<pre><code>public class Hand implements Iterable&lt;Card&gt; {
    private final List&lt;Card&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    private final int capacity;

    //...

    @Override
    public Iterator&lt;Card&gt; iterator() {
        return list.iterator();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is an implementation of a <em>Hand</em> as you can have cards in your hand while playing a Trading Card Game.</p>

<p>Essentially it wraps a <code>List&lt;Card&gt;</code>, ensures a maximum capacity and offers some other useful features. It is better as implementing it directly as a <code>List&lt;Card&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Now, for convienience I thought it would be nice to implement <code>Iterable&lt;Card&gt;</code>, such that you can use enhanced for-loops if you want to loop over it. (My <code>Hand</code> class also provides a <code>get(int index)</code> method, hence the <code>Iterable&lt;Card&gt;</code> is justified in my opinion.)</p>

<p>The <code>Iterable</code> interface provides the following (left out javadoc):</p>

<pre><code>public interface Iterable&lt;T&gt; {
    Iterator&lt;T&gt; iterator();

    default void forEach(Consumer&lt;? super T&gt; action) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(action);
        for (T t : this) {
            action.accept(t);
        }
    }

    default Spliterator&lt;T&gt; spliterator() {
        return Spliterators.spliteratorUnknownSize(iterator(), 0);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now can you obtain a stream with:</p>

<pre><code>Stream&lt;Hand&gt; stream = StreamSupport.stream(hand.spliterator(), false);
</code></pre>

<p>So onto the real question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why does <code>Iterable&lt;T&gt;</code> not provide a default methods that implement <code>stream()</code> and <code>parallelStream()</code>, I see nothing that would make this impossible or unwanted?</li>
</ul>

<p>A related question I found is the following though: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20129762/why-does-streamt-not-implement-iterablet"">Why does Stream&lt;T&gt; not implement Iterable&lt;T&gt;?</a><br>

<p>Is there a way to directly get and change the variables without using get and set methods? I remember reading an article on the Google dev site saying this is not recommended for performance on Android.</p>

<p><strong>When does type erasure occur?</strong> At compile time or runtime? When the class is loaded? When the class is instantiated?</p>

<p>A lot of sites (including the official tutorial mentioned above) say type erasure occurs at compile time. If the type information is completely removed at compile time, how does the JDK check type compatibility when a method using generics is invoked with no type information or wrong type information?</p>

<p>Consider the following example: Say class <code>A</code> has a method, <code>empty(Box&lt;?&nbsp;extends&nbsp;Number&gt;&nbsp;b)</code>. We compile <code>A.java</code> and get the class file <code>A.class</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public class A {
    public static void empty(Box&lt;? extends Number&gt; b) {}
}
</code></pre>



<pre><code>public class Box&lt;T&gt; {}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we create another class <code>B</code> which invokes the method <code>empty</code> with a non-parameterized argument (raw type): <code>empty(new Box())</code>. If we compile <code>B.java</code> with <code>A.class</code> in the classpath, javac is smart enough to raise a warning. So <code>A.class</code> <em>has</em> some type information stored in it.</p>

<pre><code>public class B {
    public static void invoke() {
        // java: unchecked method invocation:
        //  method empty in class A is applied to given types
        //  required: Box&lt;? extends java.lang.Number&gt;
        //  found:    Box
        // java: unchecked conversion
        //  required: Box&lt;? extends java.lang.Number&gt;
        //  found:    Box
        A.empty(new Box());
    }
}

<p>My guess would be that type erasure occurs when the class is loaded, but it is just a guess. So when does it happen? </p>

<p>I can import this file as a certificate in Internet Explorer (without having to enter a password!) and use it to authenticate with the webservice.</p>

<p>I was able to import this certificate into a keystore by first stripping the first and last line, converting to unix newlines and running a base64-decode. The resulting file can be imported into a keystore (using the <code>keytool</code> command). When I list the entries in the keystore, this entry is of the type <code>trustedCertEntry</code>. Because of this entry type (?) I cannot use this certificate to authenticate with the webservice. I'm beginning to think that the provided certificate is a public certificate which is being used for authentication...</p>

<p>A workaround I have found is to import the certificate in IE and export it as a <code>.pfx</code> file. This file can be loaded as a keystore and can be used to authenticate with the webservice. However I cannot expect my clients to perform these steps every time they receive a new certificate. So I would like to load the <code>.cer</code> file directly into Java. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Additional info: the company behind the webservice told me that the certificate should be requested (using IE &amp; the website) from the PC and user that would import the certificate later.</p>

<p>Given two string <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> how will you check if <code>s1</code> is a <strong>rotated</strong> version of <code>s2</code> ?</p>

<p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong> </p>

<p>If <code>s1 = ""stackoverflow""</code> then the following are some of its rotated versions:</p>

""ackoverflowst""
""overflowstack""

<p>where as <code>""stackoverflwo""</code> is <strong><em>not</em></strong> a rotated version.</p>

<p>The answer he gave was:<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take <code>s2</code> and find the longest prefix that is a sub string of <code>s1</code>, that will give you the point of rotation. Once you find that point, break <code>s2</code> at that point to get <code>s2a</code> and <code>s2b</code>, then just check if <code>concatenate(s2a,s2b) == s1</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thrown when a stack overflow occurs because an application recurses too deeply.</p>

<p>But this raises two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aren't there other ways for a stack overflow to occur, not only through recursion?</li>
<li>Does the StackOverflowError happen before the JVM actually overflows the stack or after?</li>
</ul>

<p>To elaborate on the second question:</p>

<p>When Java throws the StackOverflowError, can you safely assume that the stack did not write into the heap? If you shrink the size of the stack or heap in a try/catch on a function that throws a stack overflow, can you continue working? Is this documented anywhere?</p>

<p>Answers I am not looking for:</p>

<p>I'm writing a Java client that needs to do a simple <code>POST</code> of data to a particular <code>URL</code>. That part works fine, the only problem is it's supposed to be done over <code>HTTPS</code>. The <code>HTTPS</code> part is fairly easy to handle (either with <code>HTTPclient</code> or using Java's built-in <code>HTTPS</code> support), but I'm stuck on authenticating with client certificates. I've noticed there's already a very similar question on here, which I haven't tried out with my code yet (will do so soon enough). My current issue is that - whatever I do - the Java client never sends along the certificate (I can check this with <code>PCAP</code> dumps).</p>

<p>I would like to know what exactly the client is supposed to present to the server when authenticating with certificates (specifically for Java - if that matters at all)? Is this a <code>JKS</code> file, or <code>PKCS#12</code>? What's supposed to be in them; just the client certificate, or a key? If so, which key?

<p>The following is my understanding of the different frameworks, please correct me if im wrong. This is a very loosely defined set of questions, but i still think its valuable for anyone thinking of creating rich gui applications.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_AWT"">AWT</a></strong></p>

<p>Is the very foundation of swing, it performs well but is lacking in advanced components. If you intend to create rich applications, AWT is probably not the way to go. However for smaller gui applications that doesn't require rich user interfaces. This might suit perfectly as it's a tried and proven framework. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Swing"">Swing</a></strong></p>

<p>Based on AWT as previously stated. In its infancy it was regarded as slow and buggy and caused IBM to create SWT for Eclipse. However with Java 5 (or 6?) Swing became the framework of choice for building new applications. Swing has a lot of rich components but are still lacking in some areas. One example being that there isn't a full featured TreeTable component which can do sorting and filtering/searching.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Widget_Toolkit"">SWT</a></strong></p>

<p>Created by IBM for Eclipse, they seemed to think that Swing was not suited for Eclipse at the time. By itself is pretty low-level, and it uses the platform's native widgets through JNI. It is not related to Swing and AWT at all. Their API is however somewhat clunky and not intuitive. They do have some advanced component's like a TreeTable. (but i don't think they support sorting and filtering out of the box). SWT uses some native bindings (through JNI?) and the rant on the internet is that this framework should not be used in today's projects. (why not?)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SwingX"">SwingX</a></strong></p>

<p>Based on Swing and it's mission is to create rich components for swing. Still under development. (not very active though.) Have a very nice set of components, like for example TreeTable. But the TreeTable does not support filtering and sorting as far as i know. It does however support searching with highlighting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that SwingX is components (AFAIU) that are extensions or
  compositions of existing Swing components</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>JGoodies</strong></p>

<p>A framework which i know nothing about... What is it's strengths and weaknesses? What set's Jgoodies apart from the rest?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JGoodies OTOH is about PLAFs and layouts.</p>

<p>It's main focus seems to be on RIA (Rich internet applications), but it seems it can also be applied to desktop applications. And as a personal comment, Looks very interesting! I Especially like that it's an apache project.</p>

<p>So, to try to summarize a bit of what im asking:</p>

<p>Say i wanted to create a desktop application today in Java which involves a lot of advanced components, what should i choose? And why?</p>

<p>Which one of these frameworks should be recognized as deprecated and which should be recognized as the frameworks of the distant future?</p>

<p>What is todays de-facto-standard framework and which tools do you utilize to create java gui applications?</p>

<hr>

<p>I might regret asking this, but ill try it anyways:</p>

<p>C#/.Net is said to have a very good set of easy to use components which can be flexed in every direction possible. And after investigating different java frameworks to some extent i can't seem to say the same about Java. Why is this? <em>Why doesn't java (which is the most widely used programming language in the world) have the same set of GUI components?</em> </p>

<p>Is it just that java has based their gui components at a much lower level, and it is possible to write all these advanced components that im looking for, but you have to do much if not all of the work yourself?</p>

<p>One way to do this would be to actually change the RestTemplate source code and add some extra logging statements there, but I would find this approach really a last resort thing. There should be some way to tell Spring Web Client/RestTemplate to log everything in a much friendlier way.</p>

<p>My goal would be to be able to do this with code like :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the setup we have is we first test it <em>locally</em> (means we need to instal MySql on our PC); </p></li>
<li><p>then we push to <strong>Bitbucket</strong>;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jenkins</strong> automatically detects the new push to Bitbucket and does a build on it (for Jenkins mvn build to pass we also need to install MySql on the virtual machines that is running Jenkins). </p></li>
<li><p>if Jenkins build passes  we push the code to our application on <strong>OpenShift</strong> (using the Openshift deployment plugin on Jenkins). </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>The problem we have</em></strong> as you may have already figured it out is that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>in <code>application.properties</code> we can not hard code the MySql info. Since our project will be running in 3 different places (<em>local</em>, <em>Jenkins</em>, and <em>OpenShift</em>) we need to make the datasource field dynamic in <code>application.properties</code> (we know there are different way's of doing it but we are working on this solution for now).</p>

<pre><code>spring.datasource.url = 
spring.datasource.username = 
spring.datasource.password = 
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>The solution we came up with is we <em>create system environment variables</em> locally and in the Jenkins vm (naming them the same way OpenShift names them) and assigning them the right values respectively:</p>

<pre><code>export OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST=""jdbc:mysql://localhost""
export OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT=""3306""
export OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME=""root""
export OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD=""123asd""
</code></pre>

<p>We have done this and it works. We have also checked with <code>Map&lt;String, String&gt; env = System.getenv();</code> that the environment variables can be made into java variables as such:</p>

<pre><code>String password = env.get(""OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD"");   
String userName = env.get(""OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME"");   
String sqlURL = env.get(""OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST""); 
String sqlPort = env.get(""OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT"");
</code></pre>

<p>Now the only thing left is we need to use these java variables in our <code>application.properties</code> and that is what we are having trouble with.  </p>

<p>In which folder, and how, do we need to assign the <code>password</code>, <code>userName</code>, <code>sqlURL</code>, and <code>sqlPort</code> variables for <code>application.properties</code> to be able to see them and how do we include them in <code>application.properties</code>?</p>

<p>We have tried many things one of them being:</p>

<pre><code>spring.datasource.url = ${sqlURL}:${sqlPort}/""nameofDB""
spring.datasource.username = ${userName}
spring.datasource.password = ${password}
</code></pre>

<p>No luck so far.  We are probably not putting these env variables in the right class/folder or are using them incorrectly in <code>application.properties</code>. </p>

<p>Your help is highly appreciated!!</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>In which situation would you need to use <code>orElseGet()</code>? If you have a method <code>T myDefault()</code> why wouldn't you just do <code>optional.orElse(myDefault())</code> rather than <code>optional.orElseGet(() -&gt; myDefault())</code> ?</p>

<p>It does not seem that <code>orElseGet()</code> is postponing the execution of the lambda expression to some later time or something, so what's the point of it?

Map&lt;String, Class&lt;java.util.Date&gt;&gt; result = null;
assertThat(result, is(expected));

<p>This does not compile with the JUnit <code>assertThat</code> method signature of:</p>

<pre><code>public static &lt;T&gt; void assertThat(T actual, Matcher&lt;T&gt; matcher)
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler error message is:</p>

<pre><code>Error:Error:line (102)cannot find symbol method

<p>However, if I change the <code>assertThat</code> method signature to:</p>

<pre><code>public static &lt;T&gt; void assertThat(T result, Matcher&lt;? extends T&gt; matcher)
</code></pre>

<p>Then the compilation works.</p>

<p>So three questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why exactly doesn't the current version compile? Although I vaguely understand the covariance issues here, I certainly couldn't explain it if I had to.</li>
<li>Is there any downside in changing the <code>assertThat</code> method to <code>Matcher&lt;? extends T&gt;</code>? Are there other cases that would break if you did that?</li>
<li>Is there any point to the genericizing of the <code>assertThat</code> method in JUnit? The <code>Matcher</code> class doesn't seem to require it, since JUnit calls the matches method, which is not typed with any generic, and just looks like an attempt to force a type safety which doesn't do anything, as the <code>Matcher</code> will just not in fact match, and the test will fail regardless. No unsafe operations involved (or so it seems).</li>
</ol>

<p>For reference, here is the JUnit implementation of <code>assertThat</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public static &lt;T&gt; void assertThat(T actual, Matcher&lt;T&gt; matcher) {

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/google/guava"" rel=""noreferrer"">Google Guava</a> (formerly ""Google Collections"")</li>
<li><a href=""http://commons.apache.org/collections/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Apache Commons Collections</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Both are free, have the bidirectional map implementation that I was looking for (BidiMap in Apache, BiMap in Google), are amazingly nearly the same size (Apache 493 kB, Google 499 kB) [ed.: no longer true!] and seem in all ways pretty similar to me.</p>

<p>Which one should I choose, and why? Are there some other equivalent alternatives (must be free and have at least the bidirectional map)? I'm working with the latest Java SE, so no need to artificially limit to Java 5 or anything like that.</p>

But I have a problem in maven library dependencies so that I can't include all maven dependencies automatically - IDEA shows dependency errors only when I open that class/ Thats what I get here:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5K5p.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So I want all dependencies to be added automatically - is that possible or do I have to go through all class files to identify and add maven dependencies?!</p>

<p>UPDATE: After doing some modifications I found how to resolve my problem in some way. Thats what I did:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KslcB.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>but I think logically it will not include and check new dependencies ahead?!... Is there any settings area for this in intelliJ - auto export dependencies to classpath ?!</p>

<pre><code>interface Interface1 {
    default void method1() {
        synchronized (this) {
            // Something

<p>I will get the full synchronisation semantics that I can use also in classes. I cannot, however, use the <code>synchronized</code> modifier on method declarations:</p>

<pre><code>interface Interface2 {
    default synchronized void method1() {
        //  ^^^^^^^^^^^^ Modifier 'synchronized' not allowed here
    }

    static synchronized void method2() {
        // ^^^^^^^^^^^^ Modifier 'synchronized' not allowed here
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, one can argue that the two interfaces behave the same way except that <code>Interface2</code> establishes a <em>contract</em> on <code>method1()</code> and on <code>method2()</code>, which is a bit stronger than what <code>Interface1</code> does. Of course, we might also argue that <code>default</code> implementations should not make any assumptions about concrete implementation state, or that such a keyword simply wouldn't pull its weight.</p>

<p>However, I still get the error. What could this be caused by? Apart from the silentSMS app being an Eclipse project and me porting the code over to Android Studio I haven't changed anything. In terms of Android Studio spotting errors - it doesn't, and everything else looks fine.</p>

I'm using Tomcat 7 for this (no particular reason, I don't exploit any new feature, I just wanted to try that). Every time I debug my application, it happens that Eclipse debugger pops out like it has reached a breakpoint, but it is not the case, in fact it stops on a Java source file that is <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code>. There is no stack trace on the console, it just stops. Then if I click on resume it goes on and the app works perfectly. This is what shows in the debugger window:</p>

<p><strong>Option 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code>logger.debug(""some debug text"");
</code></pre>

<p>but some links suggest that it is better to check <code>isDebugEnabled()</code> first, like: </p>

<p><strong>Option 2:</strong></p>

<pre><code>boolean debugEnabled = logger.isDebugEnabled();
if (debugEnabled) {
    logger.debug(""some debug text"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is ""<strong>Does option 2 improve performance any way?</strong>"".</p>

<p>Because in any case Log4J framework have same check for debugEnabled. For option 2 it might be beneficial if we are using multiple debug statement in single method or class, where the framework does not need to call <code>isDebugEnabled()</code> method multiple times (on each call); in this case it calls <code>isDebugEnabled()</code> method only once, and if Log4J is configured to debug level then actually it calls <code>isDebugEnabled()</code> method twice:</p>

<ol>
<li>In case of assigning value to debugEnabled variable, and</li>
<li>Actually called by logger.debug() method.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't think that if we write multiple <code>logger.debug()</code> statement in method or class and calling <code>debug()</code> method according to option 1 then it is overhead for Log4J framework in comparison with option 2. Since <code>isDebugEnabled()</code> is a very small method (in terms of code), it might be good candidate for inlining.</p>

I've been asked this question on my job interview and I thought it might be useful to learn a bit more.</p>

<p>These are the ones I could come up with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Java is ""platform independent"". Well nowadays you could say there is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_%28software%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mono</a> project so C# could be considered too but
I believe it is a bit exaggerating. Why? Well, when a new release of Java is done it is simultaneously available on all platforms it supports, on the other hand how many features of C# 3.0 are still missing in the Mono implementation? Or is it really <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime"" rel=""noreferrer"">CLR</a> vs. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JRE"" rel=""noreferrer"">JRE</a> that we should compare here?</li>
<li>Java doesn't support events and delegates. As far as I know.</li>
<li>In Java all methods are virtual</li>
<li>Development tools: I believe there isn't such a tool yet as Visual Studio. Especially if you've worked with team editions you'll know what I mean.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please add others you think are relevant.</p>

Just popped up my mind, Java doesn't have something like custom attributes on classes, methods etc. Or does it?</p>

In one test, I want <code>Foo.someMethod()</code> to return a certain value, while in another test, I want it to return a different value.  The problem I'm having is that it seems I need to rebuild the mocks to get this to work correctly.  I'd like to avoid rebuilding the mocks, and just use the same objects in each test. </p>

<pre><code>class TestClass {

    private static Foo mockFoo;

    @BeforeClass

        mockFoo = mock(Foo.class);
    }

    @Test
    public void test1() {
        when(mockFoo.someMethod()).thenReturn(0);

        TestObject testObj = new TestObject(mockFoo);

        testObj.bar(); // calls mockFoo.someMethod(), receiving 0 as the value

    }

    @Test

    }

}

<p>In the second test, I'm still receiving 0 as the value when testObj.bar() is called... What is the best way to resolve this?  Note that I know I could use a different mock of <code>Foo</code> in each test, however, I have to chain multiple requests off of <code>mockFoo</code>, meaning I'd have to do the chaining in each test.</p>

<p>When I attempt to create an object on the heap and there's insufficient memory to do so, the JVM creates an <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/OutOfMemoryError.html"">java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</a> on the heap and throws it to me.</p>

<p>So implicitly, this means that there is some memory reserved by the JVM on startup.</p>

<p>What happens when this reserved memory is used up (it would definitely be used up, read discussion below) and the JVM does not have enough memory on the heap to create an instance of <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/OutOfMemoryError.html"">java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</a>?</p>

<p>Does it just hang? Or would he throw me a <code>null</code> since there's no memory to <code>new</code> an instance of OOM ?</p>

<pre><code>try {
    Object o = new Object();
    // and operations which require memory (well.. that's like everything)
} catch (java.lang.OutOfMemoryError e) {
    // JVM had insufficient memory to create an instance of java.lang.OutOfMemoryError to throw to us
    // what next? hangs here, stuck forever?
    // or would the machine decide to throw us a ""null"" ? (since it doesn't have memory to throw us anything more useful than a null)
    e.printStackTrace(); // e.printStackTrace() requires memory too.. =X
}

<p>==</p>

<p><strong>Why couldn't the JVM reserve sufficient memory?</strong></p>

<p>No matter how much memory is reserved, it is still possible for that memory to be used up if the JVM does not have a way to ""reclaim"" that memory:</p>

<pre><code>try {
    Object o = new Object();
} catch (java.lang.OutOfMemoryError e) {
    // JVM had 100 units of ""spare memory"". 1 is used to create this OOM.
    try {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (java.lang.OutOfMemoryError e2) {
        // JVM had 99 units of ""spare memory"". 1 is used to create this OOM.
        try {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (java.lang.OutOfMemoryError e3) {
            // JVM had 98 units of ""spare memory"". 1 is used to create this OOM.
            try {
                e.printStackTrace();
            } catch (java.lang.OutOfMemoryError e4) {
                // JVM had 97 units of ""spare memory"". 1 is used to create this OOM.
                try {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                } catch (java.lang.OutOfMemoryError e5) {
                    // JVM had 96 units of ""spare memory"". 1 is used to create this OOM.
                    try {

                        e.printStackTrace();
                        //........the JVM can't have infinite reserved memory, he's going to run out in the end

However, despite the output indicating that the program didn't reach the exit condition, it reached the exit condition (it was both reached <strong>and</strong> not reached?). Why?</p>

<p>JPARepository has only a <strong>save</strong> method, which does not tell me if it's create or update actually. For example, I insert a simple Object to the database User, which has three fields: <code>firstname</code>, <code>lastname</code> and <code>age</code>:</p>

<pre><code> @Entity
 public class User {

  private String firstname;
  private String lastname;
  //Setters and getters for age omitted, but they are the same as with firstname and lastname.
  private int age;

  @Column
  public String getFirstname() {
    return firstname;
  }
  public void setFirstname(String firstname) {
    this.firstname = firstname;
  }

  @Column
  public String getLastname() {
    return lastname;
  }
  public void setLastname(String lastname) {
    this.lastname = lastname;
  }

  private long userId;

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
  public long getUserId(){
    return this.userId;
  }

  public void setUserId(long userId){
    this.userId = userId;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I simply call <code>save()</code>, which at this point is actually an insert into database:</p>

<pre><code> User user1 = new User();
 user1.setFirstname(""john""); user1.setLastname(""dew"");
 user1.setAge(16);

 userService.saveUser(user1);// This call is actually using the JPARepository: userRepository.save(user);
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good. Now I want to update this user, say change his age. For this purpose I could use a Query, either QueryDSL or NamedQuery, whatever. But, considering I just want to use spring-data-jpa and the JPARepository, how do I tell it that instead of an insert I want to do an update? </p>

<p>Specifically, how do I tell spring-data-jpa that users with the same username and firstname are actually EQUAL and that the existing entity supposed to be updated? Overriding equals did not solve this problem.</p>

<p>The purpose of these tokens is fairly sensitive - used for session id, password reset links etc. So they do need to be cryptographically random to avoid somebody guessing them or brute force them feasibly. The token is a ""long"" so it is 64 bits long.</p>

<p>The code currently uses the <code>java.util.Random</code> class to generate these tokens. The <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Random.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">documentation</a> for <code>java.util.Random</code> clearly states the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instances of java.util.Random are not cryptographically secure. Consider instead using SecureRandom to get a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator for use by security-sensitive applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the way the code is currently using <code>java.util.Random</code> is this - It instantiates the <code>java.security.SecureRandom</code> class and then uses the <code>SecureRandom.nextLong()</code> method to obtain the seed that is used for instantiating the <code>java.util.Random</code>class. Then it uses <code>java.util.Random.nextLong()</code> method to generate the token.</p>

<p>So my question now - Is it still insecure given that the <code>java.util.Random</code> is being seeded using <code>java.security.SecureRandom</code>? Do I need to modify the code so that it uses <code>java.security.SecureRandom</code> exclusively to generate the tokens?</p>

<p>Currently the code seed's the <code>Random</code> once at startup</p>

<p>We're going to start altering our working practices to mitigate the problem, including a greater emphasis on the hosted-mode browser, which defers the need to run the GWT compiler until a later time, but that brings its own risks, particularly that of not catching issues with real browsers until much later than we'd like.</p>

<p>Ideally, we'd like to make the GWT compiler itself quicker - a minute to compile a fairly small application is taking the piss. However, we are using the compile if a fairly naive fashion, so I'm hoping we can make some quick and easy gains.</p>

<p>We're currently invoking com.google.gwt.dev.Compiler as a java application from ant Ant target, with 256m max heap and lots of stack space. The compiler is launched by Ant using fork=true and the latest Java 6 JRE, to try and take advantage of Java6's improved performance. We pass our main controller class to the compiler along with the application classpath, and off it goes.</p>

<p>What else can we do to get some extra speed? Can we give it more information so it spends less time doing discovery of what to do?</p>

<p>I know we can tell it to only compile for one browser, but we need to do multi-browser testing, so that's not really practical.</p>

<p>How do you organize your classes in your Java project?  </p>

<p>For instance, a project I'm working on with a few people has a package called beans. It started out being a project containing simple beans, but has ended up (through poor experience and lack of time) containing everything (almost).  I've cleaned them up a little, by putting some factory classes in a factory package (classes with static methods that create beans) but we have other classes that do business logic and others that do simple processing (not with business logic) like retrieving a message for a code from a properties file.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT - the reason why the first snippet is safe:</strong></p>

<p>Let me just explain things with a little more detail, based on the good answers already provided (which were essentially focused on the question of difference of performance between the 2 snippets):</p>

<p>Strings are immutable in Java, which means that a String object cannot be modified after its construction.
Hence,</p>

<p><code>String s = ""hello"";</code> creates a new String instance and assigns its address to <code>s</code> (<code>s</code> being a reference to the instance/object)</p>

<p><code>String backup_of_s = s;</code> creates a new variable <code>backup_of_s</code> and initializes it so that it references the object currently referenced by <code>s</code>.</p>

<p><em>What is <code>Observer</code> and <code>Observable</code> and when should we use them?</em></p>

<p>I wasn't aware of these terms, so when I got back home and started Googling about <code>Observer</code> and <code>Observable</code>, I found some points from different resources:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Observable.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Observable</code></a> is a class and <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Observer.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Observer</code></a> is an interface.</p>
  
  <p>2) The <code>Observable</code> class maintains a list of <code>Observer</code>s.</p>
  
  <p>3) When an <code>Observable</code> object is updated, it invokes the <code>update()</code> method of each of its <code>Observer</code>s to notify that, it is changed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found this example:</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.Observable;
import java.util.Observer;

class MessageBoard extends Observable
{
    public void changeMessage(String message) 
    {
        setChanged();
        notifyObservers(message);
    }
}

class Student implements Observer 
{
    @Override
    public void update(Observable o, Object arg) 
    {
        System.out.println(""Message board changed: "" + arg);
    }
}

public class MessageBoardTest 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        MessageBoard board = new MessageBoard();
        Student bob = new Student();
        Student joe = new Student();
        board.addObserver(bob);
        board.addObserver(joe);
        board.changeMessage(""More Homework!"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a protocol to load resources using the current classloader?
This is similar to the Jar protocol, except that I do not need to know which jar file or class folder the resource is coming from.</p>

<p>I can do that using <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getResourceAsStream(java.lang.String)"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Class.getResourceAsStream(""a.xml"")</code></a>, of course, but that would require me to use a different API, and hence changes to existing code.

<p>I would like it to be grey. How can I do that?</p>

<p>In the Play Store, for example, the arrow is white.</p>

<p>I've done this to set some styles. I have used <code>@drawable/abc_ic_ab_back_mtrl_am_alpha</code> for <code>homeAsUpIndicator</code>. That drawable is transparent (only alpha) but the arrow is displayed in black. I wonder if I can set the color like I do in the <code>DrawerArrowStyle</code>. Or if the only solution is to create my <code>@drawable/grey_arrow</code> and use it for <code>homeAsUpIndicator</code>.</p>

<p>My solution so far has been to take the <code>@drawable/abc_ic_ab_back_mtrl_am_alpha</code>, which seems to be white, and paint it in the color I desire using a photo editor. It works, although I would prefer to use <code>@color/actionbar_text</code> like in <code>DrawerArrowStyle</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, it's trivial to implement it manually:</p>

<p><em>edit: I especially want to know if any caching is involved on file/directory level. As in ""are directory listings cached in the Class version?""</em></p>

<p>AFAIK the following should essentially do the same, but they are not:</p>

<pre><code>getClass().getResource() 
getClass().getClassLoader().getResource()
</code></pre>

<p>I discovered this when fiddling with some report generation code that creates a new file in <code>WEB-INF/classes/</code> from an existing file in that directory. When using the method from Class, I could find files that were there at deployment using <code>getClass().getResource()</code>, but when trying to fetch the newly created file, I recieved a null object. Browsing the directory clearly shows that the new file is there. The filenames were prepended with a forward slash as in ""/myFile.txt"".</p>

<p>The <code>ClassLoader</code> version of <code>getResource()</code> on the other hand did find the generated file. From this experience it seems that there is some kind of caching of the directory listing going on. Am I right, and if so, where is this documented?</p>

<p>From the <a href=""http://download.oracle.com/javase/1,5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getResource%28java.lang.String%29"">API docs</a> on <code>Class.getResource()</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finds a resource
  with a given name. The rules for
  searching resources associated with a
  given class are implemented by the
  defining class loader of the class.
  This method delegates to this object's
  class loader. If this object was
  loaded by the bootstrap class loader,
  the method delegates to
  ClassLoader.getSystemResource(java.lang.String).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me, this reads ""Class.getResource is really calling its own classloader's getResource()"". Which would be the same as doing <code>getClass().getClassLoader().getResource()</code>. But it is obviously not. Could someone please provide me with some illumination into this matter?</p>

<p><code>List</code>: is a raw type, therefore not <code>typesafe</code>. It will only generate a runtime error when the casting is bad. We want a compile time error when the cast is bad. Not recommended to use.</p>

<p><code>List&lt;?&gt;</code> is an unbounded wildcard. But I'm not sure what it's for? I can print a <code>List&lt;?&gt;</code> without issue:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
@Table(name = ""AUTHORITY_"")
public class Authority implements Serializable {

  public enum Right {
      READ(100), WRITE(200), EDITOR (300);

      private int value;

      Right(int value) { this.value = value; }

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
  @Column(name = ""AUTHORITY_ID"")
  private Long id;

  // the enum to map : 
  private Right right;
}
</code></pre>

<p>A simple solution is to use the Enumerated annotation with EnumType.ORDINAL:</p>

<pre><code>@Column(name = ""RIGHT"")
@Enumerated(EnumType.ORDINAL)
private Right right;
</code></pre>

<p>But in this case JPA maps the enum index (0,1,2) and not the value I want (100,200,300).</p>

<p>Th two solutions I found do not seem simple...</p>

<h2>First Solution</h2>

<p>A solution, <a href=""http://forums.java.net/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=32048"" rel=""noreferrer"">proposed here</a>, uses @PrePersist and @PostLoad to convert the enum to an other field and mark the enum field as transient:</p>

<pre><code>@Basic
private int intValueForAnEnum;

@PrePersist
void populateDBFields() {
  intValueForAnEnum = right.getValue();
}

@PostLoad
void populateTransientFields() {
  right = Right.valueOf(intValueForAnEnum);
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Second Solution</h2>

<p>The second solution <a href=""http://appfuse.org/display/APF/Java+5+Enums+Persistence+with+Hibernate"" rel=""noreferrer"">proposed here</a> proposed a generic conversion object, but still seems heavy and hibernate-oriented (@Type doesn't seem to exist in Java EE): </p>

<pre><code>@Type(
    type = ""org.appfuse.tutorial.commons.hibernate.GenericEnumUserType"",
    parameters = {
            @Parameter(
                name  = ""enumClass"",                      
                value = ""Authority$Right""),
            @Parameter(
                name  = ""identifierMethod"",
                value = ""toInt""),
            @Parameter(
                name  = ""valueOfMethod"",
                value = ""fromInt"")
            }
)
</code></pre>

<h2>Is there any other solutions ?</h2>

<p>I've several ideas in mind but I don't know if they exist in JPA:</p>

<ul>
<li>use the setter and getter methods of right member of Authority Class when loading and saving the Authority object</li>
<li>an equivalent idea would be to tell JPA what are the methods of Right enum to convert enum to int and int to enum</li>
<li>Because I'm using Spring, is there any way to tell JPA to use a specific converter (RightEditor) ?</li>

<p>It occurs when the jboss server in which the servlet is deployed is started.
It is compiled with jdk-1.5.0_11 and I tried to recompile it with jdk-1.5.0_15 without succes. That is the compilation runs fine but when deployed, the java.lang.VerifyError occurs.</p>

<p>When I changed the method name and got the following error:</p>

<p>You can see that more of the method signature is shown.</p>

<p>The actual method signature is</p>

<pre><code>  private PgasePdfTable getMonthData(int month, int year, Collection dayTypes,
                          Collection calendarDays,
                          HashMap bcSpecialDays,

                          Locale locale, MessageResources resources) throws   Exception {
</code></pre>

<p>I already tried looking at it with <code>javap</code> and that gives the method signature as it should be.</p>

<p>When my other colleagues check out the code, compile it and deploy it, they have the same problem. When the build server picks up the code and deploys it on development or testing environments (HPUX), the same error occurs. Also an automated testing machine running Ubuntu shows the same error during server startup.</p>

<p>The rest of the application runs okay, only that one servlet is out of order.
Any ideas where to look would be helpful.</p>

<li>Questions asking for library recommendations are usually considered off-topic, because ""they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam"", but I don't think that applies here.

<p>I would like to configure 3 different named Loggers that can be returned by a LoggerFactory which will log different levels and push the messages to different appenders:</p>

<ul>
<li>Logger 1 ""FileLogger"" logs DEBUG and appends to <code>DailyRollingFileAppender</code></li>
<li>Logger 2 ""TracingLogger"" logs TRACE+ and appends to a <code>JmsAppender</code></li>
<li>Logger 3 ""ErrorLogger"" logs ERROR+ and appends to a different <code>JmsAppender</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore I want them configured programmatically (in Java, as opposed to XML or a <code>log4j.properties</code> file).</p>

<p>I imagine that, normally, I would define these <code>Logger</code>s somewhere in some bootstrapping code, like an <code>init()</code> method. However, because I want to use <code>slf4j-log4j</code>, I'm confused about where I could define loggers and make them available to the classpath.</p>

<p>I don't <em>believe</em> this is a violation of SLF4J's underlying purpose (as a facade), because my code using the SLF4J API won't ever know that these loggers exist. My code just makes normal calls to the SLF4J API, which then forwards them on to the log4j Loggers it finds on the classpath.</p>

<p><strong>But how do I configure those log4j Loggers on the classpath...in Java?!</strong></p>

<pre><code>int adjust = size() - 1;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; axes.size(); i++) {
    adjust *= 31;
    adjust = ~~adjust;
    // in GWT, we have to deal with integer overflow carefully
}
int hash = 1;
for (Set&lt;E&gt; axis : axes) {
    hash = 31 * hash + (size() / axis.size() * axis.hashCode());

    hash = ~~hash;
}
hash += adjust;
return ~~hash;
</code></pre>

<p>Both of <code>adjust</code> and <code>hash</code> are <code>int</code>s. From what I know about Java, <code>~</code> means bitwise negation, so <code>adjust = ~~adjust</code> and <code>hash = ~~hash</code> should leave the variables unchanged. Running the small test (with assertions enabled, of course),</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = Integer.MIN_VALUE; i &lt; Integer.MAX_VALUE; i++) {
    assert i == ~~i;
}
</code></pre>

<p>confirms this. Assuming that the Guava guys know what they are doing, there must be a reason for them to do this. The question is what?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> As pointed out in the comments, the test above doesn't include the case where <code>i</code> equals <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>. Since <code>i &lt;= Integer.MAX_VALUE</code> is always true, we will need to check that case outside the loop to prevent it from looping forever. However, the line</p>

<pre><code>assert Integer.MAX_VALUE == ~~Integer.MAX_VALUE;
</code></pre>

<p>yields the compiler warning ""Comparing identical expressions"", which pretty much nails it.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: according to BalusC's steps below, I came up with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>public class UrlRewriteFilter implements Filter {

    @Override
    public void init(FilterConfig config) throws ServletException {
        //
    }

    @Override
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res, FilterChain chain) throws ServletException, IOException {
        HttpServletRequest request = (HttpServletRequest) req;
        String requestURI = request.getRequestURI();

        if (requestURI.startsWith(""/Check_License/Dir_My_App/"")) {
            String toReplace = requestURI.substring(requestURI.indexOf(""/Dir_My_App""), requestURI.lastIndexOf(""/"") + 1);
            String newURI = requestURI.replace(toReplace, ""?Contact_Id="");
            req.getRequestDispatcher(newURI).forward(req, res);
        } else {
            chain.doFilter(req, res);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void destroy() {
        //
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The relevant entry in <code>web.xml</code> look like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;filter&gt;
    &lt;filter-name&gt;urlRewriteFilter&lt;/filter-name&gt;

    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;

<p>I tried both server-side and client-side redirect with the expected results. It worked, thanks BalusC!</p>

<p>Factory Method - Defines an interface for creating objects, but let subclasses to decide which class to instantiate and Refers to the newly created object through a common interface.</p>

    );
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>This gives <strong>incorrect</strong> output of <code>[0, 0, 0]</code> which corresponds to the <em>counts</em> for the three columns that are all <code>false</code>.

<p>However, it appears that the same thing is wrong if we represent the ternary operator with an <code>if</code> statement (as in the <code>same()</code> method), which <em>does</em> issue a compile-time error! Why?</p>

What I'm uncertain about is exactly <em>what</em> goes in the Controller.</p>

<p>Lets say for example I have a fairly simple application (I'm specifically thinking Java, but I suppose the same principles apply elsewhere). I organise my code into 3 packages called <code>app.model</code>, <code>app.view</code> and <code>app.controller</code>.</p>

<p>Within the <code>app.model</code> package, I have a few classes that reflect the actual behaviour of the application. These <code>extends Observable</code> and use <code>setChanged()</code> and <code>notifyObservers()</code> to trigger the views to update when appropriate.</p>

<p>The <code>app.view</code> package has a class (or several classes for different types of display) that uses <code>javax.swing</code> components to handle the display. Some of these components need to feed back into the Model. If I understand correctly, the View shouldn't have anything to do with the feedback - that should be dealt with by the Controller.</p>

<p>So what do I actually put in the Controller? Do I put the <code>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)</code> in the View with just a call to a method in the Controller? If so, should any validation etc be done in the Controller? If so, how do I feedback error messages back to the View - should that go through the Model again, or should the Controller just send it straight back to View?</p>

<p>If the validation is done in the View, what do I put in the Controller?</p>

<p>Sorry for the long question, I just wanted to document my understanding of the process and hopefully someone can clarify this issue for me!</p>

<p>Spoilers below.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you print <code>X</code> in scale(long) and redefine <code>X = scale(10) + 3</code>,
the prints will be <code>X = 0</code> then <code>X = 3</code>.
This means that <code>X</code> is temporarily set to <code>0</code> and later set to <code>3</code>.
This is a violation of <code>final</code>!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The static modifier, in combination with the final modifier, is also used to define constants. 
  The final modifier indicates that the value of <strong>this field cannot change</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>My question: 
Is this a bug? 
Is <code>final</code> ill-defined?</p>

<hr>

<p>Here is the code that I am interested in.
<code>X</code> is assigned two different values: <code>0</code> and <code>3</code>.
I believe this to be a violation of <code>final</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public class RecursiveStatic {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(scale(5));
    }

    private static final long X = scale(10) + 3;

    private static long scale(long value) {
        System.out.println(""X = "" + X);
        return X * value;
    }
}

<hr>

<p>This question has been flagged as a possible duplicate of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27859435/"">Java static final field initialization order</a>. 
I believe that this question is <strong>not</strong> a duplicate since 
the other question addresses the order of initialization while 
my question addresses a cyclic initialization combined with the <code>final</code> tag.
From the other question alone, I would not be able to understand why the code in my question does not make an error.</p>

<p>This is especially clear by looking at the output that ernesto gets: 
when <code>a</code> is tagged with <code>final</code>, he gets the following output:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;properties&gt;
    &lt;java.version&gt;1.8&lt;/java.version&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but when researching I found that you can also specify java version in maven compiler plugin, like that:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;plugins&gt;
    &lt;plugin&gt;    
        &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-compiler-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;configuration&gt;
            &lt;source&gt;1.8&lt;/source&gt;
            &lt;target&gt;1.8&lt;/target&gt;
        &lt;/configuration&gt;
    &lt;/plugin&gt;
&lt;/plugins&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then wrap this into plugin management tag to enable child poms usage of this. So the first question is <strong>what are the differences beetwen setting java version in properties and in maven compiler plugin?</strong></p>

<p>I couldn't find clear answer but in process of researching I found that you can also specify java version in this way:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;properties&gt;
    &lt;maven.compiler.source&gt;1.8&lt;/maven.compiler.source&gt;
    &lt;maven.compiler.target&gt;1.8&lt;/maven.compiler.target&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which suggest that compiler plugin is there even if I dont explicit declare it. Running mvn package outputs with </p>

<pre><code>maven-compiler-plugin:3.1:compile (default-compile) @ testproj ---
</code></pre>

<p>and some other plugins that I didn't declare. <strong>So are those plugins default, hidden part of maven pom? Are there any differences beetwen setting source/target in properties and in maven plugin configuration element?</strong></p>

<p>Some other questions are - which way should be used (and when if they are not equal)? Which one is best for multi-module project and what happens if java version specified in pom is different than version pointed in JAVA_HOME?</p>

<p>This is the main content of a method whose sole purpose is to return the array of floats. I want this method to return <code>null</code> if there is an error, so I put the loop inside a <code>try...catch</code> block, like this:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The consensus seems to be that it is cleaner to put the loop inside the try/catch, possibly inside its own method. However, there is still debate on which is faster. Can someone test this and come back with a unified answer?</p>

<p>If there's a free library out there that does this in a reliable, cross-platform manner, that would be great (even if it makes external calls or uses native code itself).</p>

<p>To clarify, I would like to get the current CPU usage for the whole system, not just the Java process(es).</p>

<p>The SIGAR API provides all the functionality I'm looking for in one package, so it's the best answer to my question so far. However, due it being licensed under the GPL, I cannot use it for my original purpose (a closed source, commercial product). It's possible that Hyperic may license SIGAR for commercial use, but I haven't looked into it. For my GPL projects, I will definitely consider SIGAR in the future.</p>

<p>For my current needs, I'm leaning towards the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>For CPU usage, <code>OperatingSystemMXBean.getSystemLoadAverage() / OperatingSystemMXBean.getAvailableProcessors()</code> (load average per cpu)</li>
<li>For memory, <code>OperatingSystemMXBean.getTotalPhysicalMemorySize()</code> and <code>OperatingSystemMXBean.getFreePhysicalMemorySize()</code></li>
<li>For disk space, <code>File.getTotalSpace()</code> and <code>File.getUsableSpace()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Limitations:</p>

<p>The <code>getSystemLoadAverage()</code> and disk space querying methods are only available under Java 6. Also, some JMX functionality may not be available to all platforms (i.e. it's been reported that <code>getSystemLoadAverage()</code> returns -1 on Windows).</p>

    this.serviceA = serviceA;
    //etc
  } 

}
</code></pre>

<p>Later when you inherit from <code>Super</code>, java will complain that there is no default constructor defined. The solution is obviously something like:</p>

<pre><code>public class Son extends Super{

  public Son(ServiceA serviceA, ServiceB serviceB, ServiceC serviceC){
    super(serviceA,serviceB,serviceC);
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>This code is repetitive, not DRY and useless (IMHO)... so that brings the question again:</p>

<p><strong>Why java doesn't support constructor inheritance? Is there any benefit in not allowing this inheritance?</strong></p>

  <p>Thread lifecycle overhead. Thread creation and teardown are not free.

I've been told that one of the big advantages of Java EE is that it is easy to scale (which I believe means you can deploy different components on different servers). Is that where Remote and Local interfaces come in? Are you supposed to use Remote interfaces if you expect your application to have different components on different servers? And use Local interfaces if your application is only going to reside on one server?</p>

<p>If my assumptions above are correct, how would you go about choosing whether to use Local or Remote interfaces for a new application, where your unsure of what the volume of traffic would be? Start off by using Local interfaces, and gradually upgrade to Remote interfaces where applicable?</p>

<p>Both answers were extremely helpful. I wanted to add a little: my real-life scenario does not involve a collection of raw <code>BigDecimal</code>s, they are wrapped in an invoice.

    invoices.add(new Invoice(""C3"", ""I-003"", BigDecimal.valueOf(2.3), BigDecimal.valueOf(8)));
    invoices.add(new Invoice(""C4"", ""I-004"", BigDecimal.valueOf(1.2), BigDecimal.valueOf(7)));

    // Classical Java approach
    BigDecimal sum = BigDecimal.ZERO;
    for(Invoice invoice : invoices) {
        BigDecimal total = invoice.unit_price.multiply(invoice.quantity);
        System.out.println(total);
        sum = sum.add(total);
    }
    System.out.println(""Sum = "" + sum);

    // Java 8 approach
    invoices.forEach((invoice) -&gt; System.out.println(invoice.total()));
    System.out.println(""Sum = "" + invoices.stream().map((x) -&gt; x.total()).reduce((x, y) -&gt; x.add(y)).get());

I was building a simple program to display every X outputs in a for loop, and I noticed a MASSIVE decrease in performance, when I used modulus as <code>variable % variable</code> vs <code>variable % 5000</code> or whatnot. Can someone explain to me why this is and what is causing it? So I can be better...</p>

<p>Here is the ""efficient"" code (sorry if I get a bit of syntax wrong I'm not on the computer with the code right now)</p>

<pre><code>long startNum = 0;
long stopNum = 1000000000L;

for (long i = startNum; i &lt;= stopNum; i++){
    if (i % 50000 == 0) {
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the ""inefficient code""</p>

<pre><code>long startNum = 0;
long stopNum = 1000000000L;
long progressCheck = 50000;

for (long i = startNum; i &lt;= stopNum; i++){
    if (i % progressCheck == 0) {
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Mind you I had a date variable to measure the differences, and once it became long enough, the first one took 50ms while the other took 12 seconds or something like that. You may have to increase the <code>stopNum</code> or decrease the <code>progressCheck</code> if your PC is more efficient than mine or what not.</p>

<p>I looked for this question around the web, but I can't find an answer, maybe I'm just not asking it right.</p>

<p>EDIT:
I did not expect my question to be so popular, I appreciate all the answers. I did perform a benchmark on each half in time taken, and the inefficient code took considerably longer, 1/4 of a second vs 10 seconds give or take. Granted they are using println, but they are both doing the same amount, so I wouldn't imagine that would skew it much, especially since the discrepancy is repeatable. As for the answers, since I am new to Java, I will let votes decide for now which answer is best. I will try to pick one by Wednesday.</p>

<p>EDIT2:
I am going to make another test tonight, where instead of modulus, it just increments a variable, and when it reaches progressCheck, it will perform one, and then reset that variable to 0. for a 3rd option.</p>

<p>EDIT3.5:</p>

<p>I used this code, and below I'll show my results.. Thank you ALL for the wonderful help! I also tried comparing the short value of the long to 0, so all my new checks happen ever ""65536"" times making it equal in repeats.</p>

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixed = 874 ms (normally around 1000ms, but faster due to it being a power of 2)</li>
<li>variable = 8590 ms</li>
<li>final variable = 1944 ms (Was ~1000ms when using 50000)</li>
<li>increment = 1904 ms</li>
<li>Short Conversion = 679 ms</li>
</ul>

<p>Not surprising enough, due to a lack of division, the Short Conversion was 23% faster than the ""fast"" way. This is interesting to note. If you need to show or compare something every 256 times (or about there) you can do this, and use </p>

<pre><code>if ((byte)integer == 0) {'Perform progress check code here'}
</code></pre>

<p>ONE FINAL INTERESTING NOTE, using modulus on the ""Final declared Variable"" with 65536 (not a pretty number) was half the speed of (slower) than the fixed value. Where before it was benchmarking near the same speed.</p>

<li>The Android documentation for a <code>SparseArray</code> says ""It is generally slower than a traditional <code>HashMap</code>"".</li>
<li>If you write code using <code>HashMap</code>s rather than <code>SparseArray</code>s your code will work with other implementations of Map and you will be able to use all of the Java APIs designed for Maps.</li>

<p>My biggest argument for omitting the curly braces is that it can sometimes be twice as many lines with them. For example, here is some code to paint a glow effect for a label in C#.</p>

<pre><code>using (Brush br = new SolidBrush(Color.FromArgb(15, GlowColor)))
{
    for (int x = 0; x &lt;= GlowAmount; x++)
    {
        for (int y = 0; y &lt;= GlowAmount; y++)

            g.DrawString(Text, this.Font, br, new Point(IconOffset + x, y));
        }
     }
 }
 //versus
using (Brush br = new SolidBrush(Color.FromArgb(15, GlowColor)))
    for (int x = 0; x &lt;= GlowAmount; x++)
        for (int y = 0; y &lt;= GlowAmount; y++)
            g.DrawString(Text, this.Font, br, new Point(IconOffset + x, y));
</code></pre>

<p>You can also get the added benefit of chaining <code>usings</code> together without having to indent a million times.</p>

<pre><code>using (Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(bmp))
{
    using (Brush brush = new SolidBrush(backgroundColor))
    {
        using (Pen pen = new Pen(Color.FromArgb(penColor)))
        {
            //do lots of work
        }
    }
 }
//versus
using (Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(bmp))
using (Brush brush = new SolidBrush(backgroundColor))
using (Pen pen = new Pen(Color.FromArgb(penColor)))
{
    //do lots of work
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The most common argument for curly braces revolves around maintance programming, and the problems that would ensue by inserting code between the original if statement and its intended result:</p>

<pre><code>if (foo)
    Bar();
    Biz();
</code></pre>

<h3>Questions:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Is it wrong to want to use the more compact syntax which the language offers? The people that design these languages are smart, I can't imagine they would put a feature which is always bad to use.</li>
<li>Should we or Shouldn't we write code so the lowest common denominator can understand and have no problems working with it? </li>
<li>Is there another argument that I'm missing?</li>

<p>For instance, in this article named <a href=""http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=7590"" rel=""noreferrer"">Typing: Strong vs. Weak, Static vs. Dynamic</a> says that Python is strongly typed because you get an exception if you try to:</p>

<p><strong>Python</strong></p>

<pre><code>1 + ""1""
Traceback (most recent call last):
File """", line 1, in ? 
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
</code></pre>

<p>However, such thing is possible in Java and in C#, and we do not consider them weakly typed just for that.</p>

<p><strong>Java</strong></p>

<pre><code>  int a = 10;
  String b = ""b"";
  String result = a + b;
  System.out.println(result);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>C#</strong></p>

<pre><code>int a = 10;
string b = ""b"";
string c = a + b;
Console.WriteLine(c);
</code></pre>

<p>In this another article named <a href=""http://www.i-programmer.info/programming/theory/1469-type-systems-demystified-part2-weak-vs-strong.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Weakly Type Languages</a> the author says that Perl is weakly typed simply because I can concatenate a string to a number and viceversa without any explicit conversion.</p>

<p><strong>Perl</strong></p>

<pre><code>$a=10;
$b=""a"";
$c=$a.$b;
print $c; #10a
</code></pre>

<p>So the same example makes Perl weakly typed, but not Java and C#?.</p>

<p>Gee, this is confusing <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/U5kPT.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The authors seem to imply that a language that prevents the application of certain operations on values of different types is strongly typed and the contrary means weakly typed.</p>

<p>Therefore, at some point I have felt prompted to believe that if a language provides a lot of automatic conversions or coercion between types (as perl) may end up being considered weakly typed, whereas other languages that provide only a few conversions may end up being considered strongly typed. </p>

<p>I am inclined to believe, though, that I must be wrong in this interepretation, I just do not know why or how to explain it.</p>

<p>So, my questions are: </p>

<ul>
<li>What does it really mean for a language to be truly weakly typed? </li>
<li>Could you mention any good examples of weakly typing that are not related to automatic conversion/automatic coercion done by the language?</li>
<li>Can a language be weakly typed and strongly typed at the same time?</li>
</ul>

<p>What are the steps to configure a HA-JNDI service with a HornetQ setup? I believe the documentation is a little scattered. I have read through the docs <a href=""https://docs.jboss.org/jbossclustering/cluster_guide/5.1/html/clustering-jndi.html#clustering-jndi-jboss"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> but doesn't seem to illustrate in detail.</p>

<p>Longer version:</p>

<p>So we have a HornetQ JMS setup along with JNDI. We have say 5 servers, that run the HornetQ JMS master instance with JNDI service on each. On each of these 5 servers, we also have a slave running for some other HornetQ master. </p>

<p>To illustrate:</p>

<pre><code>Server A - HornetQa_master, JNDI, HornetQb_slave
Server B - HornetQb_master, JNDI, HornetQc_slave
Server C - HornetQc_master, JNDI, HornetQd_slave
Server D - HornetQd_master, JNDI, HornetQe_slave
Server E - HornetQe_master, JNDI, HornetQa_slave
</code></pre>

<p>Each of these HornetQ servers serve as middleware for our various backend needs, so that means 5 servers, 5 HornetQ master instances, 5 HornetQ slave instances and 5 JNDI servers. The problem, however, with this setup is that if a server host (not just the process, the host itself), say A goes down, ideally the service should fallback to the HornetQ running on server E which hosts A's HornetQ slave. However, to resume as HornetQ master, the HornetQa_slave needs to talk to the JNDI process running on server A (I presume to replicate messages). Since the host A is itself down, the HornetQa_slave running on E has no way to talk to the JNDI on A, and thus, cannot resume as the master process. </p>

<p>Had the JNDI service been highly available, the slave HornetQ process could resume as master as expected. Could anyone kindly point to the docs or illustrate in simple steps how we could convert our existing setup to a HA-JNDI? For what it's worth, I have read multiple <a href=""https://docs.jboss.org/jbossclustering/cluster_guide/5.1/html/clustering-jndi.html#clustering-jndi-jboss"" rel=""noreferrer"">sources</a>, but it doesn't seem to illustrate in much detail about how to get going with configuring a HA-JNDI. Please let me know if you need more info about our current setup.</p>

I have done a bit of experimenting with it, but a few things are unclear to me regarding consumer offset. From what I have understood so far, when a consumer starts, the offset it will start reading from is determined by the configuration setting <code>auto.offset.reset</code> (correct me if I am wrong).</p>
<p>Now say for example that there are 10 messages (offsets 0 to 9) in the topic, and a consumer happened to consume 5 of them before it went down (or before I killed the consumer). Then say I restart that consumer process. My questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If the <code>auto.offset.reset</code> is set to <code>earliest</code>, is it always going to start consuming from offset 0 ?</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the <code>auto.offset.reset</code> is set to <code>latest</code>, is it going to start consuming from offset 5 ?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is the behaviour regarding this kind of scenario always deterministic ?</p>

<p>I answered like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we create a string in java like <code>String s1=""hello"";</code> then an
  object will be created in <strong>string pool(hello)</strong> and <strong>s1</strong> will be
  pointing to <strong>hello</strong>.Now if again we do <code>String s2=""hello"";</code> then
  another object will not be created but <strong>s2</strong> will point to <code>hello</code>
  because <strong>JVM</strong> will first check if the same object is present in
  <strong>string pool</strong> or not.If not present then only a new one is created else not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now if suppose java allows string mutable then if we change <strong>s1</strong> to <code>hello world</code> then <strong>s2</strong> value will also be <code>hello world</code> so java String is immutable.</p>

<p>I have 3 solutions in mind, but I can have miss some,  and I'd like to have your opinion</p>

<p>edit: include Bohzo propositon and refine question: it's more about deep cloning than shallow cloning.</p>

<h2>Do it yourself:</h2>

<p>code the clone by hand properties after properties and check that mutable instances are cloned too.<br>
<strong>pro:</strong><br>
- control of what will be performed<br>
- quick execution<br>
<strong>cons:</strong><br>
- tedious to write and maintain<br>
- bug prone (copy/paste failure, missing property, reassigned mutable property) </p>

<h2>Use reflection:</h2>

<p>With your own reflection tools or with an external helper (like jakarta common-beans) it is easy to write a generic copy method that will do the job in one line.<br>
<strong>pro:</strong><br>
- easy to write<br>
- no maintenance<br>
<strong>cons:</strong><br>
- less control of what happens<br>
- bug prone with mutable object if the reflection tool does not clone sub objects too<br>
- slower execution</p>

<h2>Use clone framework:</h2>

<p>Use a framework that do it for you, like :<br>
<a href=""http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-3.0.1/org/apache/commons/lang3/SerializationUtils.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">commons-lang SerializationUtils</a><br>
<a href=""https://github.com/kostaskougios/cloning"" rel=""noreferrer"">Java Deep Cloning Library</a><br>
<a href=""http://dozer.sourceforge.net/documentation/about.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dozer</a><br>
<a href=""https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kryo</a></p>

<p><strong>pro:</strong><br>
- same as reflection<br>
- more control over what will be exactly be cloned.<br>
<strong>cons:</strong><br>
- every mutable instance is fully cloned, even at the end of the hierarchy<br>
- could be very slow to execute</p>

<h2>Use bytecode instrumentation to write clone at runtime</h2>

<p><a href=""http://www.jboss.org/javassist"" rel=""noreferrer"">javassit</a>, <a href=""http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">BCEL</a> or <a href=""http://cglib.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">cglib</a> might be use to generate a dedicated cloner as fast as one hand writed. Someone knows a lib using one of these tools for this purpose ?</p>

<p>What I have missed here ?<br>
Which one would you recommend ?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>My problem is that Spring Boot sets up a default redirect for controller exceptions to <code>/error</code>.  From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Spring Boot provides an /error mapping by default that handles all errors in a sensible way, and it is registered as a ‘global’ error page in the servlet container. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Coming from years writing REST applications with Node.js, this is, to me, anything but sensible.  Any exception a service endpoint generates should return in the response.  I can't understand why you'd send a redirect to what is most likely an Angular or JQuery SPA consumer which is only looking for an answer and can't or won't take any action on a redirect.</p>

<p>What I want to do is set up a global error handler that can take any exception - either purposefully thrown from a request mapping method or auto-generated by Spring (404 if no handler method is found for the request path signature), and return a standard formatted error response (400, 500, 503, 404) to the client without any MVC redirects.  Specifically, we are going to take the error, log it to NoSQL with a UUID, then return to the client the right HTTP error code with the UUID of the log entry in the JSON body.</p>

<p>The docs have been vague on how to do this.  It seems to me that you have to either create your own <a href=""http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.2.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/web/ErrorController.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">ErrorController</a> implementation or use <a href=""http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/ControllerAdvice.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">ControllerAdvice</a> in some fashion, but all the examples I've seen still include forwarding the response to some kind of error mapping, which doesn't help.  Other examples suggest that you'd have to list every Exception type you want to handle instead of just listing ""Throwable"" and getting everything.</p>

int a_ = 3;
if (_a == 1 &amp;&amp; a == 2 &amp;&amp; a_ == 3) {

<p><strong>ADDED:</strong></p>

<p>I think the common way is to have source in the eclipse folder called ""workspace"". So, how do I get my files in these directory. Should I use eclipse to create a new project from existing source and Eclipse will put all file to the workspace? Or I  should manually copy all my files to the workspace? Where should I put my class files than? Should I create a subdirectory? With which name?</p>

<p><strong>ADDED 2:</strong></p>

<p>When I try to create a project with name ""game"", the eclipse writes me that a project with such name already exist. But how can I open this project?</p>

<p><strong>ADDED 3:</strong></p>

<p>In my ""workspace"" I have created a subdirectory called ""game"". I copied all my .java file into this subdirectory. Then with Eclipse I created a new project with the name game. As a result, Eclipse created <code>.classpath</code> and <code>.project</code> files in the directory ""game"". It also created <code>bin</code> and <code>src</code> subdirectories. And now I think it is not the correct way to go. The source files are supposed to be in the ""src"" directory. Right? And at the moment all my .java files are in the ""workspace\game"".</p>

<p><strong>ADDED 4:</strong></p>

<p>I did it other way around. With Eclipse I have created a new project with the name ""game"". As the result, Eclipse created a folder called ""game"" into folder ""workspace"". In ""game"" the folder I found ""src"" folder. I copied all my .java files into this folder. But now in the ""Package Explorer"" I cannot open ""src"" folder. So, how can I access my source files from Eclipse? Why Eclipse does not want to open the ""src"" folder?</p>

<p>I want to create a <code>Map&lt;int[], double&gt;</code> that maps each int[] to a running count as the list is iterated over, but Map doesn't take primitive types.</p>

<p>Why is better to use <code>toString()</code>? I mean toString may be overridden when name() is already final. So if you use toString and someone overrides it to return a hard-coded value your whole application is down... Also if you look in the sources the toString() method returns exactly and just the name.

&lt;X extends String&gt; X getString() {

<p>and it compiles? The compiler should know that <code>Integer</code> does not implement <code>CharSequence</code>. The call to</p>

<p>gives an error (as expected)</p>

<pre><code>incompatible types: inference variable X has incompatible upper bounds java.lang.Integer,java.lang.String

<p>Can someone explain why would this behaviour be considered valid? How would it be useful?</p>

<p>The client does not know that this call is unsafe - the client's code compiles without warning. Why wouldn't the compile warn about that / issue an error?</p>

<p>Also, how is it different from this example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;X extends CharSequence&gt; void doCharSequence(List&lt;X&gt; l) {
}

List&lt;CharSequence&gt; chsL = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
doCharSequence(chsL); // compiles

doCharSequence(intL); // error

  required: java.util.List&lt;X&gt;

<p>Here is my <code>QuickRandom</code> class in its entirety:</p>

<pre><code>public class QuickRandom {
    private double prevNum;
    private double magicNumber;

    public QuickRandom(double seed1, double seed2) {
        if (seed1 &gt;= 1 || seed1 &lt; 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Seed 1 must be &gt;= 0 and &lt; 1, not "" + seed1);
        prevNum = seed1;
        if (seed2 &lt;= 1 || seed2 &gt; 10) throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Seed 2 must be &gt; 1 and &lt;= 10, not "" + seed2);
        magicNumber = seed2;
    }

    public QuickRandom() {
        this(Math.random(), Math.random() * 10);
    }

    public double random() {
        return prevNum = (prevNum*magicNumber)%1;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the code I wrote to test it:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
        QuickRandom qr = new QuickRandom();

        /*for (int i = 0; i &lt; 20; i ++) {
            System.out.println(qr.random());
        }*/

        //Warm up
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10000000; i ++) {
            Math.random();
            qr.random();
            System.nanoTime();
        }

        long oldTime;

        oldTime = System.nanoTime();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000000; i ++) {
            Math.random();
        }
        System.out.println(System.nanoTime() - oldTime);

        oldTime = System.nanoTime();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000000; i ++) {
            qr.random();
        }
        System.out.println(System.nanoTime() - oldTime);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is a very simple algorithm that simply multiplies the previous double by a ""magic number"" double. I threw it together pretty quickly, so I could probably make it better, but strangely, it seems to be working fine.</p>

<p>Wow! It performs almost 4 times faster than <code>Math.random</code>.</p>

<p>I remember reading somewhere that <code>Math.random</code> used <code>System.nanoTime()</code> and tons of crazy modulus and division stuff. Is that really necessary? My algorithm performs a lot faster and it seems pretty random.</p>

<p>I have two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is my algorithm ""good enough"" (for, say, a game, where <strong>really</strong> random numbers aren't too important)?</li>
<li>Why does <code>Math.random</code> do so much when it seems just simple multiplication and cutting out the decimal will suffice?</li>
</ul>

<p><code>class PropHolder</code> is a class of my own. The class resides in the same JAR file of the main class. So that should not because any JAR is missing from classpath.</p>

<p>When I look in to the JAR file by <code>jar tf myjarfile</code>, I can see the <code>PropHolder.class</code> listed there.</p>

<p>Btw: the code is running fine on my local machine. But couldn't work when I deploy it with some script onto a Linux server. So I think it is not the problem of the code.
But for some reason. the deploy process is very hard to track.</p>

<p><br>
But I am not able to understand what I am achieving with <em>ContextLoaderListener</em> which internally initializes the <em>WebApplicationContext</em> ?</p>

<p><strong>As per my understanding</strong>, <em>ContextLoaderListener</em>  reads the Spring configuration file (with value given against contextConfigLocation in <em>web.xml</em>), parses it and loads the <em>singleton bean</em> defined in that config file. Similarly when we want to load <em>prototype bean</em>, we will use same webapplication context to load it. So we initialize the webapplication  with <em>ContextLoaderListener</em> so that we read/parse/validate the config file in advance and whenever we wan to inject dependency we can straightaway do it without any delay. Is this understanding correct?</p>

<li>Check the Android project properties, make sure the appcompat library is added properly.</li>

<li>Confirm the class is included in the library (android.support.v7.internal.view.menu.MenuBuilder).</li>
<li>Confirm R.java is located in gen directory for android.support.v7.appcompat.</li>
<li>Confirm the AppCompat theme is included in the Manifest.xml activity.</li>
<li>Clean and rebuild project.</li>

    } catch (IOException ex) {
        // handle ex
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is nice and short, but it is broken. Because the underlying <code>FileWriter</code> is not declared in a variable, it will never be closed directly in the generated <code>finally</code> block. It will be closed only through the <code>close</code> method of the wrapping <code>BufferedWriter</code>. The problem is, that if an exception is thrown from the <code>bw</code>'s constructor, its <code>close</code> will not be called and therefore the underlying <code>FileWriter</code> <strong>will not be closed</strong>.</p>

<h2>2)</h2>

<pre><code>static void printToFile2(String text, File file) {
    try (FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(file);
            BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw)) {
        bw.write(text);
    } catch (IOException ex) {
        // handle ex
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here, both the underlying and the wrapping resource are declared in the ARM-managed variables, so both of them will certainly be closed, but the underlying <code>fw.close()</code> <strong>will be called twice</strong>: not only directly, but also through the wrapping <code>bw.close()</code>.</p>

<p>This should not be a problem for these two specific classes that both implement <code>Closeable</code> (which is a subtype of <code>AutoCloseable</code>), whose contract states that multiple calls to <code>close</code> are permitted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Closes this stream and releases any system resources associated with it. If the stream is already closed then invoking this method has no effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, in a general case, I can have resources that implement only <code>AutoCloseable</code> (and not <code>Closeable</code>), which doesn't guarantee that <code>close</code> can be called multiple times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that unlike the close method of java.io.Closeable, this close method is not required to be idempotent. In other words, calling this close method more than once may have some visible side effect, unlike Closeable.close which is required to have no effect if called more than once. However, implementers of this interface are strongly encouraged to make their close methods idempotent.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>3)</h2>

<pre><code>static void printToFile3(String text, File file) {
    try (FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(file)) {
        BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);
        bw.write(text);
    } catch (IOException ex) {
        // handle ex
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This version should be theoretically correct, because only the <code>fw</code> represents a real resource that needs to be cleaned up. The <code>bw</code> doesn't itself hold any resource, it only delegates to the <code>fw</code>, so it should be sufficient to only close the underlying <code>fw</code>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the syntax is a bit irregular and also, Eclipse issues a warning, which I believe is a false alarm, but it is still a warning that one has to deal with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Resource leak: 'bw' is never closed</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>So, which approach to go for? Or have I missed some other idiom that is <em>the correct</em> one?</p>

<p>When the NetFlow packet is observed from the Wireshark the flow sets with the template id 263 contains the data about initiator octets and responder octets which can be used to determine the number of bytes associated with a flow.

<p>This is the code segment which is used to get the dOctets. This returns zero even for the template ID 263.</p>
<p>But when it's calculated with respect to the NetFlow template id 263 it gives the correct data. (gives the initiator octets and to get responder octet 46 should be replaced with 50 as the length of the particular record is 4 bytes)</p>
<pre><code>dOctets = Util.to_number(buf, off + 46, 4)

<p>46 is where the Initiator Octets record lies in that particular NetFlow packet.(got using the Wireshark record.)</p>
<p>Is it a problem with jnca? Hopefully, somebody who's familiar with jcna can give me some help on this.</p>

<pre><code>@WebServiceClient(name = ""StatusManagement"", 
                  wsdlLocation = ""c:/some_absolute_path_to_a_wsdl_file.wsdl"",
                  targetNamespace = ""http://tempuri.org/"") 
public class StatusManagement extends Service {

    public final static QName SERVICE = new QName(""http://tempuri.org/"", ""StatusManagement"");
    public final static QName WSHttpBindingIStatus = new QName(""http://tempuri.org/"", ""WSHttpBinding_IStatus"");
    static {
        URL url = null;
        try {
            url = new URL(""c:/some_absolute_path_to_a_wsdl_file.wsdl"");
        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {

            // e.printStackTrace();
        }
        WSDL_LOCATION = url;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The hardcoded absolute path really sucks. The generated class won't work in any other computer other than mine.</p>

<p>The first idea is to put the WSDL file (plus everything it imports, other WSDLs and XSDs) somewhere in a jar-file and classpath it. But we want to avoid this. Since all that thing was generated by CXF and JAXB based in the WSDLs and XSDs, we see no point in needing to know the WSDL at runtime.</p>

<p>The wsdlLocation attribute is intended to override the WSDL location (at least this is what i readed somewhere), and it default value is """". Since we are using maven, we tried to include <code>&lt;wsdlLocation&gt;&lt;/wsdlLocation&gt;</code> inside the configuration of CXF to try to force the source generator to leave the wsdlLocation blank. However, this simply makes it ignore the XML tag because it is empty. We did a really ugly shameful hack, using <code>&lt;wsdlLocation&gt;"" + ""&lt;/wsdlLocation&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>This changes other places too:</p>

<pre><code>@WebServiceClient(name = ""StatusManagement"", 
                  wsdlLocation = """" + """",
                  targetNamespace = ""http://tempuri.org/"") 
public class StatusManagement extends Service {

    public final static URL WSDL_LOCATION;
    public final static QName SERVICE = new QName(""http://tempuri.org/"", ""StatusManagement"");
    public final static QName WSHttpBindingIStatus = new QName(""http://tempuri.org/"", ""WSHttpBinding_IStatus"");
    static {
        URL url = null;
        try {
            url = new URL("""" + """");
        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
            System.err.println(""Can not initialize the default wsdl from "" + """");
            // e.printStackTrace();
        }
        WSDL_LOCATION = url;
    }

<ol>
<li><p>Does we really need a WSDL location even if all the classes were generated by CXF and JAXB? If yes, why?</p></li>
<li><p>If we do not really need the WSDL location, what is the proper and clean way to make CXF not generate it and avoiding it entirely?</p></li>
<li><p>What bad side effects we could get with that hack? We still can't test that to see what happens, so if someone could say in advance, it would be nice.</p></li>

<p>However, when I check the JAVA_HOME variable I get:</p>

<pre><code># echo $JAVA_HOME 
/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle

<p>My JAVA_HOME is defined in .bashrc and I have double checked that it is set as the source.</p>

<p>Running <code>java -version</code> also confirms that JAVA_HOME is set correctly and is on the PATH.</p>

<p>I have also checked that <code>/usr/bin/java</code> symlinks to <code>/etc/alternatives/java</code> which in turn correctly symlinks to <code>/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/bin/java</code></p>

<p>Additionally I've checked that there are no duplicate JAVA_HOME definitions in <code>.bash_profile</code> or <code>/etc/profile</code>. </p>

<p>So my question is how/why does Gradle find <code>/usr/lib/jvm/default-java</code>, and more importantly how do I point it to the correct directory? </p>

The problem is that the site uses a self-signed certificate.  I have a copy of the certificate to verify that I'm not encountering a man-in-the-middle attack, and I need to incorporate this certificate into our code in such a way that the connection to the server will be successful.</p>

<p>Here's the basic code:</p>

<pre><code>void sendRequest(String dataPacket) {
  String urlStr = ""https://host.example.com/"";
  URL url = new URL(urlStr);
  HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection();
  conn.setMethod(""POST"");
  conn.setRequestProperty(""Content-Length"", data.length());
  conn.setDoOutput(true);
  OutputStreamWriter o = new OutputStreamWriter(conn.getOutputStream());
  o.write(data);
  o.flush();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Without any additional handling in place for the self-signed certificate, this dies at conn.getOutputStream() with the following exception:</p>

<pre><code>Exception in thread ""main"" javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
....
Caused by: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
....
Caused by: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally, my code needs to teach Java to accept this one self-signed certificate, for this one spot in the application, and nowhere else.</p>

<p>I know that I can import the certificate into the JRE's certificate authority store, and that will allow Java to accept it.  That's not an approach I want to take if I can help; it seems very invasive to do on all of our customer's machines for one module they may not use; it would affect all other Java applications using the same JRE, and I don't like that even though the odds of any other Java application ever accessing this site are nil.  It's also not a trivial operation: on UNIX I have to obtain access rights to modify the JRE in this way.</p>

<p>I've also seen that I can create a TrustManager instance that does some custom checking.  It looks like I might even be able to create a TrustManager that delegates to the real TrustManager in all instances except this one certificate.  But it looks like that TrustManager gets installed globally, and I presume would affect all other connections from our application, and that doesn't smell quite right to me, either.</p>

<p>What is the preferred, standard, or best way to set up a Java application to accept a self-signed certificate?  Can I accomplish all of the goals I have in mind above, or am I going to have to compromise?  Is there an option involving files and directories and configuration settings, and little-to-no code?</p>

class ValueList {

<li><code>--conf spark.executor.extraLibraryPath=...</code></li>
<li>not to forget, the last parameter of the spark-submit is also a .jar file.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am aware where I can find the <a href=""http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">main spark documentation</a>, and specifically about <a href=""http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">how to submit</a>, the <a href=""http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">options</a> available, and also the <a href=""http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/org/apache/spark/SparkContext.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">JavaDoc</a>. However that left for me still quite some holes, although it answered partially too.</p>

<p>I hope that it is not all that complex, and that someone can give me a clear and concise answer.</p>

<p>If I were to guess from documentation, it seems that <code>--jars</code>, and the <code>SparkContext</code> <code>addJar</code> and <code>addFile</code> methods are the ones that will automatically distribute files, while the other options merely modify the ClassPath.</p>

<p>Would it be safe to assume that for simplicity, I can add additional application jar files using the 3 main options at the same time:</p>

<pre><code>spark-submit --jar additional1.jar,additional2.jar \
  --driver-library-path additional1.jar:additional2.jar \
  --conf spark.executor.extraLibraryPath=additional1.jar:additional2.jar \
  --class MyClass main-application.jar
</code></pre>

<p>Found a nice article on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/34516023/744133"">an answer to another posting</a>. However nothing new learned. The poster does make a good remark on the difference between Local driver (yarn-client) and Remote Driver (yarn-cluster). Definitely important to keep in mind.</p>

<li>No rounding is necessary.  (Numbers being displayed with k and m appended are more of analog gauge indicating approximation not precise article of logic.

Many seem to be against DTOs and simply just expose the domain model, while others seem to think DTOs (or User Models or whatever you want to call it) are bad practice. Personally, I thought that <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/barcia/entry/data_models_for_api_s_are_not_canonical_or_domain_models_they_are_your_user_model?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a> made a lot of sense.</p>

<p>However, I also understand the drawbacks of DTOs with all the extra mapping code, domain models that might be 100% identical to their DTO-counterpart and so on. </p>

<p>Our API is mostly created so that other clients may consume data, however if we do it right we would also like to use it for our own web GUI if possible. </p>

<p>The thing is that we might not want to expose all the domain data to the other client users. Much of the data will only make sense in our own web application. Also, we might not want to expose all data about an object in all scenarios, especially relationships to other objects and so on. For example, if we expose a list of a particular object we would not necessarily want to expose the entire object hierarchy; so that the object's children will not be exposed, but can be discovered through links (hateoas). </p>

<p>How should I go about solving this problem? I was thinking about using Jackson mixins on our domain models to control what data would be exposed given different scenarios. Or should we just use DTOs all the way - even given its drawbacks and controversy? </p>

<p>AFAIK, though I couldn't find it stated explicitly, getView() is only called for visible rows. Since my app starts with four visible rows at least the position numbers cycling from 0-3 makes sense. But the rest is a mess:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is getview called for each row three times? </li>
<li>Where are these convertViews coming from when I haven't scrolled yet?</li>
</ul>

<p>I did a bit of reseach, and without getting a good answer, I did notice that people were associating this issue with layout issues. So in case, here's the layout that contains the list:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    android:layout_height=""fill_parent""

        android:layout_height=""wrap_content"" /&gt;

    &lt;ListView android:id=""@+id/list""
        android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content"" 
        android:drawSelectorOnTop=""false"" /&gt;

&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the layout of each individual row:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;RelativeLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
android:layout_height=""108dp""

I'm curious how this would perform purely in Java, and OCR in general interests me, so I'd love to see how it's implemented in a language I thoroughly understand. Naturally, this would require that the implementation is open source, but I'm still interested in proprietary solutions, as I could at least check out the performance in that case.</p>

<p>For instance, imagine that I've a big request that take a very long time to process, I want to send the request and receive a notification when the request will return a value (by passing a Listener/callback or something). I don't want to block waiting for the database to answer.</p>

<p>I don't consider that using a pool of threads is a solution because it doesn't scale, in the case of heavy concurrent requests this will spawn a very large number of threads.</p>

<p>We are facing this kind of problem with network servers and we have found solutions by using select/poll/epoll system call to avoid having one thread per connection. I'm just wondering how to have a similar feature with database request?</p>

<p>Note:
I'm aware that using a FixedThreadPool may be a good work-around, but I'm surprised that nobody has developed a system really asynchronous (without the usage of extra thread).</p>

<p>** Update **<br>
Because of the lack of real practical solutions, I decided to create a library (part of finagle) myself: <a href=""https://github.com/twitter/finagle/tree/master/finagle-mysql"" rel=""noreferrer"">finagle-mysql</a>. It basically decodes/decodes mysql request/response, and use Finagle/Netty under the hood. It scales extremely well even with huge number of connections.</p>

<pre><code>package anddifferences;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 25;
        if(x &lt; 50 &amp;&amp; x &gt; 0) {
            System.out.println(""OK"");
        }

        if(x &lt; 50 &amp; x &gt; 0) {
            System.out.println(""Yup"");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It printed ""OK"" and ""Yup"".  So does it matter which one I use if they both work?</p>

<pre><code>public class Metadata implements Comparable&lt;Metadata&gt; {
    private String name;
    private String value;

// Imagine basic constructor and accessors here
// Irrelevant parts omitted
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want the <em>natural ordering</em> for these objects to be: 1) sorted by name and 2) sorted by value if name is the same; both comparisons should be case-insensitive. For both fields null values are perfectly acceptable, so <code>compareTo</code> must not break in these cases. </p>

<p>The solution that springs to mind is along the lines of the following (I'm using ""guard clauses"" here while others might prefer a single return point, but that's beside the point):</p>

<pre><code>// primarily by name, secondarily by value; null-safe; case-insensitive
public int compareTo(Metadata other) {
    if (this.name == null &amp;&amp; other.name != null){
        return -1;
    }
    else if (this.name != null &amp;&amp; other.name == null){
        return 1;
    }
    else if (this.name != null &amp;&amp; other.name != null) {
        int result = this.name.compareToIgnoreCase(other.name);
        if (result != 0){
            return result;
        }
    }

    if (this.value == null) {
        return other.value == null ? 0 : -1;
    }
    if (other.value == null){
        return 1;
    }

    return this.value.compareToIgnoreCase(other.value);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This does the job, but I'm not perfectly happy with this code. Admittedly it isn't <em>very</em> complex, but is quite verbose and tedious.</p>

<p>The question is, <strong>how would you make this less verbose</strong> (while retaining the functionality)? Feel free to refer to Java standard libraries or Apache Commons if they help. Would the only option to make this (a little) simpler be to implement my own ""NullSafeStringComparator"", and apply it for comparing both fields?</p>

<p><strong>Edits 1-3</strong>: Eddie's right; fixed the ""both names are null"" case above</p>

<h2>About the accepted answer</h2>

<p>I asked this question back in 2009, on Java 1.6 of course, and at the time <strong><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/481836/56285"">the pure JDK solution by Eddie</a></strong> was my preferred accepted answer. I never got round to changing that until now (2017).</p>

<p>There are also <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/500643/56285"">3rd party library solutions</a>—a 2009 Apache Commons Collections one and a 2013 Guava one, both posted by me—that I did prefer at some point in time.</p>

<p>I now made the clean <strong><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/23908426/56285"">Java 8 solution by Lukasz Wiktor</a></strong> the accepted answer. That should definitely be preferred if on Java 8, and these days Java 8 should be available to nearly all projects.</p>

<p>My goal is to write a function which returns an <code>int</code>. Said <code>int</code> is stored in the height of a node, and if the node is not present, it will be null, and I'll need to check that.</p>

<p>I am doing this for homework but this specific part is not part of the homework, it just helps me get through what I am doing.</p>

<p>Thanks for the comments, but it seems very few people have actually read what's under the code, I was asking how else I can accomplish this goal; it was easy to figure out that it doesn't work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caused by: java.net.SocketException:
  Software caused connection abort:
  socket write error <br>&nbsp;at
  java.net.SocketOutputStream.socketWrite0(Native
  Method)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I tried to answer the following questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What code is throwing this exception? (JVM?/Tomcat?/My code?)</li>
<li>What causes this exception to be thrown?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Regarding #1:</strong> </p>

<p>Sun's JVM source doesn't contain this exact message, but I think the text <em>Software caused connection abort: socket write error</em> is from the native implementation of <code>SocketOutputStream</code>:</p>

<pre><code>private native void socketWrite0(FileDescriptor fd, byte[] b, int off,
                 int len) throws IOException;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Regarding #2</strong></p>

<p>My guess is that it is caused when the client has terminated the connection, before getting the full response (e.g. sent a request, but before getting the full response, it got closed / terminated / offline)</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Are the above assumptions correct (#1 and #2)?</li>
<li>Can this be diffrentiated from the situation: ""could not write to the client, due to a network error on the <em>server</em> side""? or would that render the same error message?</li>
<li>And most important: <strong>Is there an official document (e.g from Sun) stating the above?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>I need to have a proof that this stack trace is the socket client's ""fault"", and there is nothing that the server could have done to avoid it. (except catching the exception, or using a non Sun JVM SocketOutputStream, though both don't really avoid the fact the client has terminated)</p>
