# StackOverflowMine

<p>Repository containing EDA done on Stack Overflow dataset for a research project. The main aim of the research project is to cluster questions on Stack Overflow into beginner, intermediate and advanced categories. The project mainly focuses on Java and questions related to use of the Java Standard Library.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this repository is to ease syncing of my work on my devices and use of Google Colab to run the algorithms. (If someone has a good strategy for this using Google Drive do tell me.) Feel free to email me suggestions on what I could try or references I might be interested in.</p>
