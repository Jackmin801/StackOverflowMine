<p>Although I probably contributed a lot to whatever processor you are using to read this on,
I am a software guy at heart. HW guys call me a SW guy, SW guys call me a HW guy.</p>

<p>In my copious free time I used to maintain a wiki on Computer Architecture, <a href=""http://comp-arch.net"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://comp-arch.net</a>. Will revive when job permits. (2020: have started reviving at <a href=""https://github.com/AndyGlew/comp-arch.net"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/AndyGlew/comp-arch.net</a>, but it won't be ready any time soon.)</p>

<p>C/C++ programmer - that's what HW simulators get written in - and system software, back when I was an OS programmer. Perl, Python - that's what we analyze the results with.</p>

<p>Code performance tuning.  (Heck, not only did I contribute to the architecture of a large part of the CPU you are using, I may have done the same for the hardware that you use to measure performance on it.)</p>

<p>Database: author of Perl SQL (not yet another interface to an SQL RDBMS - instead I implemented SQL to query experiment data as relations in flat files). (You may still be able to find it on CPAN, although be kind, it was my first object oriented Perl (4?) code.) Early member of the NoSQL movement, although I am not so much against SQL, as I am against heavyweight databases with inflexible schema.</p>

<p>Security: virtual machines, secure boot and patch; buffer overflows, code hijacking (ROP) prevention, capabilities; cryptography performance optimization.</p>

<p>Technology evangelist: XML, JSON.</p>

<p>Wannabe user interface designer/programmer.</p>

Doing lots of back-end stuff using Laravel, vue.js, and everything related to it. Also knowledgeable (although not high level) in server management. Can also do front-end. Basically almost full-stack. I said ""almost"" because for the last 3 years as of this writing, I've been doing lots of back-end so other aspects of being a ""full-stack"" might be outdated already, though I still do my best to keep my self up-to-date.</p>

<p>Subscribed in Laracasts, enrolled in a couple of Udemy courses, following twitter accounts with related interests, aspiring to rebuild my open source portfolio and what else . . . that's all I can think of right now.</p>

<p>Anyway I'm the type of guy who is sure that I don't know everything (because no one apparently does anyway) but 100% sure I am a fast learner if you give me something to work on.</p>

Most of my time is invested in learning to develop a fully functional application (like Android, nodeJs, or other technologies). I spent about 10-12 hours a day studying and practicing to improve my developing skills with the help of free online learning resources. Because of studying every day, my developing skill improves, and now I started to develop a user-end application(develop by me alone) that will be released soon in the Google Playstore hopefully. </p>

<p>But my biggest question is, I have no idea if I'm qualified to have a job in this stage. 😥</p>

<p>I am a developer with a long professional history of work with web and Microsoft technologies.</p>
<p>I am passionate about C#, VB.Net, Winforms, Web (jQuery, ASP.Net, IIS), SQL and am into a lot of tools for DevOps, Debugging, Performance, Threading, IDE and etc. My background in coding started with VB and C++, then classic asp and onto .Net.</p>
<p>At various times I have worked for Datacom, Massive Interactive, Macquarie Bank, GraysOnline.com, MLC, SKM/Jacobs Engineering, the Reserve Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and more. The highlight of my career was working for Microsoft Australia in Professional Developer PSS.</p>
<p>Solving developer support cases for Microsoft Gold and Premiere customers has helped me to answer on here. I like answering the bounty questions and helping people out who are really stuck.</p>
<p>I currently work at the NAB Cloud Guild as a trainer, best practice engineer and escalation engineer across NAB for cloud matters.</p>

I was responsible for Pixel-Perfect conversion of Photoshop PSD files to Wordpress websites, creation of clean stylesheet code (CSS), utilising agile pre-processing methods like SaaS and LESS, as well as using modern JavaScript Frameworks (jQuery &amp; React) to create modern interactive user interfaces.
Over the years I have learned how to configure and administer web servers. I have taught myself how to create &amp; scale infrastructure across popular cloud platforms such as AWS, Google, Azure, OVH &amp; IBM.
I have invested into ethical hacking studies for many years and continue to learn consistently about new security threats through VirusTotal &amp; WordFence publications and by analysing data of hacking attempts on my own servers &amp; websites I manage.
I have an expertise in creating hacker proof backend and database environments and I have a complete and thorough understanding of Cloud-side and server-side Firewall, Nginx, server-side cache, DNS, eMail and other server and client side technologies.
I have learned how to set up email servers via Amazon Web Services standard &amp; Free tier and have achieved 10 out of 10 email server ranking score on <a href=""http://www.mail-tester.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">www.mail-tester.com</a>. For example I can setup 100% free &amp; fully automated email news-letter functionality for websites, that requires very little to none maintenance and can save thousands pounds per month for medium to large scale enterprises in Email marketing costs.</p>
<p>I am ranked in the top 10% and top 5% for Wordpress development and JavaScript with jQuery skills on Upwork &amp; StackOverflow networks respectively.</p>

I write code for fun and occasionally for profit. 
Mathematics is another specialty of mine, along with interest in the physical sciences.</p>

<hr>

<p>Please don't be insulted if I take a while to respond to comments. I probably just found myself needing another break from this site.</p>

<hr>

<p>Various thoughts that still need revisions and/or re-evaluation (work in progress):</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Help people answering questions to spend their time more efficiently.</strong> By which I really mean stop answering questions in the comments, and accept answers that have helped. I often try to prioritize my time by looking through the unanswered questions list, but my effort is often foiled when I waste my time thinking about a question that turned out to have been answered in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Help people asking questions.</strong> I've noticed some non-friendly behavior towards people writing answers by some who seem to be more interested in proving an answer wrong than making the answer right. Destructive criticism vs. constructive criticism. (Admittedly, some answers are not salvageable. But many are.) Try to understand what was meant instead of stopping your thoughts with ""that's wrong"".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make it OK to be wrong.</strong> I've seen some people justify answering questions in the comments with excuses along the lines of ""I wasn't sure that was the answer."" It should be OK for someone to propose an answer, then later retract it if it turns out to be off-base. Sometimes proposing a solution to try is more efficient than getting a clarification to determine if a solution is definitely the right one. (Asking for clarification should not be the same thing as asking if a certain solution works.) An incorrect answer based on incomplete information should not be considered a bad thing. For one thing, if the question is never clarified, it might be the correct answer for the next person to find the question.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> I write these as goals; I make no claim as to whether or not I personally achieve them.</p>

Caltech Alumni 2009</p>

<p>I have written a number of open-source C++ libraries, check them out on my github page! </p>

<p>Mostly know things about Complexity, Combinatorics and Algebra. Strong background in proof complexity &amp; probabilistic combinatorics. Not extremely broad algebra background, more focus on things like Group Theory / Group Representation Theory, Category Theory, than for instance Field Theory / Galois Theory. Wish I knew more analysis, harmonic analysis, wish I understood Homological Algebra better.  </p>

<p>I like Sushi, camping, motorcycles, Nietzsche, travel, Surfing. I also like Slacklining.</p>

<p>Staff Verification Engineer with over 10 years of professional experience, plus RTL implementation and schematic experience. When I'm not resolving bugs, I'm finding ways maximize quality of the design, streamline verification, and teaching other best practices. Other skills on my tool belt: C, C++, Perl, GNUmakefile.</p>

<p>I am a advocate of <a href=""/questions/tagged/system-verilog"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;system-verilog&#39;"" rel=""tag"">system-verilog</a> because it gives flexibility for verification and enforces best practices for RTL design. Quality design can be done with only <a href=""/questions/tagged/verilog"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;verilog&#39;"" rel=""tag"">verilog</a>, however <a href=""/questions/tagged/system-verilog"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;system-verilog&#39;"" rel=""tag"">system-verilog</a> will catch basic design bugs and syntheses surprises early (e.g. transparent latches, multiple drivers on nets, procedural when intending parallel logic).</p>

I have specialized Angular framework based on JavaScript. I have worked almost exclusively in Agile projects with proven track record of taking all projects I have worked to production with high praises and rewards.</p>
<p>My strengths are in Angular web development, as I have exclusively worked on suchprojects. I am self-taught programmer and I am very much into JavaScript. I have been incredibly lucky to have very supportive colleagues who are always there to help. I am part of the cross-skill and Angular focus group from where I learn about new tech stack.</p>
<p>As an avid learner, I am open to new opportunities to learn and evolve. I would love to become a full stack developer who wishes to create products/ provide services that always puts a smile on the customer's face. Currently on the pursuit of learning React,I am always striving to improve, as I believe you can never stop learning!</p>
<p>Working and learning from a multi-cultural team is what I look forward to.
Un-learn, learn and re-learn is what I wish to do.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

I would write screenplays, call some friends, start recording, and edit everything. What I realized is that as much as I loved movies, I liked creating something new, something from scratch and on my own. That is the reason why I started programming.</p>

<p>After learning some Javascript online, I decided to sign up for the local robotics team in 2015, where I started introducing myself in Arduino and also acquired important values such as leadership and teamwork since I ended up being the team captain.</p>

<p>In 2016 I participate in an IT campus in Madrid at Carlos III University and ended up with a high performance diploma in Cyber Security. </p>

<p>In 2017 I was selected to participate in a research project at La Salle University where we had to program smart cars, which was a great opportunity for me to continue developing my Arduino skills. </p>

<p>When I turned 18, in 2018, I decided to go abroad to pursue a career in programming so I moved from Spain to The Netherlands to study Computer Science at the TU Delft, one of the best universities in Europe.</p>

<p>Since that moment, so many things have happened, I gave a TED talk, I won pitching competitions, went to conferences, courses, learned many more programming languages and cool stuff during my studies… </p>

<p>But after all, I still have the same passion, the same passion for creating new things as when I was just a kid making movies.</p>

I want to make a career change into web/software development because I enjoy problem solving and I want to develop my own creativity. 
I have a passion for languages and love learning them (studied Chinese &amp; Spanish). Coding is another language and even though it is very difficult it is not humanly impossible to learn. I know I can learn it and use it to create interesting and useful projects.
I would like to become a web developer/software engineer for Apple Inc., but I also dream about working remotely as freelance developer in order to live around the world with my family.</p>

<p>I don't believe in answering questions completely. IMHO, one gains the most when one deduces as much of the answer on their own.</p>

<p>Over the past several years on SO I learned the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The vital importance of being precise.</li>
<li>Helping others learn can enrich oneself immeasurably.</li>
<li>Some one always knows more, learn from them.</li>
</ul>

<p>I like C very much, but I think we should stop <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">teaching it (as part of teaching C++)</a>.</p>

<p>I also get a twitch in my eye every time someone on SO adds ""My Professor/Assignment forbids the use of the standard c++ library"". This is so asinine, and has nothing to do with teaching ""real"" C++.</p>

<li>I've been writing software for a <strong>few decades</strong> and I (still) love it. Over the years I've played with mainly Big Data, full-stack web apps, multi-threaded (near) real-time server apps, and embedded software.</li>
<li>At the <strong>day job</strong>, I'm working with Spark, MapR (now HPE Ezmeral), and Hadoop in general.</li>
<li>Previously I was doing web dev with D3.js, C3.js, Node.js, Express.js, Python, Bottle.py, MySQL, Apache httpd. For many years prior to that I programmed almost exclusively in C++ (some C++11, some Boost) and Perl (I much prefer Python now).</li>
<li>I've <strong>dabbled with</strong> Go, R, Java, Google AppEngine, AWS, GraphViz, IBM Streams/SPL and BigInsights, Oracle OEP, DynamoDB.  I've read books about Google Compute Engine, Heroku, Neo4j, Redis, and MongoDB, and I've taken a few Udacity iOS courses (then I switched to Ionic), but I never got around to actually trying these out (bummer, eh?).</li>
<li>I created an online <strong><a href=""https://www.udemy.com/angular-2-concepts-code-and-collective-wisdom/?couponCode=stackoverflow2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Angular course</a></strong> at udemy.com, with an emphasis on Observables, Change Detection, Dependency Injection, Data Binding, and Inter-Component Communication and Data Flow.  Too bad the course is no longer up to date.</li>
<li><strong>Current interests/learning</strong>:  Spark, Docker, Swarm, Go<br></li>
<li><strong>Open source project</strong>: <a href=""https://github.com/mrajcok/angularjs-periscope"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Peri$scope"">Peri$scope</a>, a tool that uses GraphViz to visualize AngularJS prototypal scope inheritance, properties, and services</li>
<li><strong>First computer</strong>: Commodore64 (I still have one)</li>
<li><strong>SO badge</strong> I'm most proud of: Sportsmanship</li>
<li>My <strong>profile picture</strong>: my son gave me that lego minifig years ago, but I put the Angular logo on it</li>
